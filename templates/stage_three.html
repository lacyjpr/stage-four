		<h2>Stage 3.0 Intro: Create a Movie Website</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-0-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Welcome To Stage 3</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In this stage, you'll embed
			YouTube videos into your web page. But, really what you're going
			to be doing is learning how to massively increase your power as a
			programmer because what you'll be doing is finding and using other
			people's already written, freely available code to really speed up
			how quickly you can make things.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-0-2">
			<div class="concept-title">What You'll Make</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In this stage, you'll learn to use
			other people's code to save time and effort. This will let you
			quickly add powerful functionality, like embedded movies. At the
			end of this stage, you'll write code to store a list of your
			favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer .
			You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing
			visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailers.</p></div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="lesson" id="stage-3-1">
		<h2>Stage 3.1 Introduction to Abstraction</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-1-1">
			<div class="concept-title">What Will We Create?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We will use the Python programming
			language to create a bunch of projects.</p>
			<p>The first one is Project Take a Break: We will write a program
			that schedules breaks throughout the day.</p>
			<p>Another one is called Project Profanity Editor: Say you email
			your boss, accidentally including an "awkward" word. We will write
			a short program that detects curse words and saves you from
			embarrassing moments.</p>
			<p>The final project is Project Movie Database: In this project,
			we will learn how to make a web page that lists your favorite
			movies and shows their trailers.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-1-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Comfort Level</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In many introductory computer
			science classes, the instructor starts out slow, then boom, the
			difficulty level skyrockets. This makes many students feel
			frustrated and intimidated by code, and ultimately, they quit.</p>
			<p>We will avoid that. We will make challenging projects, but at
			the same time ensure that you are comfortable with the learning
			curve.</p> </div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-1-3">
			<div class="concept-title">What Should I Know?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Prerequisites: Basic computing
			ideas</p>
				<div class="tab"><p>if statements</p></div>
				<div class="tab"><p>loops</p></div>
				<div class="tab"><p>functions</p></div>
			<p>If you need a refresher on any one of these topics, see the
			Instructor Notes.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-1-4">
			<div class="concept-title">What Will We Learn?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What programming concepts will we
			learn? We'll start with ideas we are somewhat familiar with. These
			include functions, like the simple "hello world." Soon, we will
			move on to new ideas. These ideas include Classes and Object
			oriented programming. This is a technique thats used by software
			engineers on a daily basis. They can use this technique to write
			and share code amongst each other. While we will start with
			functions we will spend most of our time learning about classes.
			</p></div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="lesson" id="stage-3-2">
		<h2>Stage 3.2 Use Functions</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Course Map</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In this stage, we will build 2
			main projects while using functions. Towards the end of the stage,
			we will present a scenario where functions don't quite present an
			elegant solution. That will pave the way for us to learn new stuff
			in future lessons.</p>
			<p>Lets write a program that schedules breaks from the computer
			throughout the day, reminding you to listen to music, get up and
			dance, or just walk away from the computer every once in a while.
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Take a Break (Output)</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>When we run the program, it starts
			to keep track of time, and after every two hours of work on the
			computer, it opens a browser to play a favorite song. After
			another two hours of work, it prompts you to take another break,
			and so on.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-3">
			<div class="concept-title">How Would You Do This?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>If you were writing the &quot;Take
			a Break&quot; program, what steps would you take to get to the
			output?</p>
			<p>Step 1: Time two hours</p>
			<p>Step 2: Open browser to music video</p>
			<p>Step 3: Repeat 1 &amp; 2</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-4">
			<div class="concept-title">One Way of Doing This</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Repeat 3 Times:</p>
				<div class="tab"><p>1. Wait for 2 hours</p></div>
				<div class="tab"><p>2. Open browser to play song</p></div>
			<p>Because we want this to happen multiple times, we need to put
			these two steps inside some sort of a loop.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Launching Python</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Go to Start menu, All Programs,
			Python 2.7, &amp; launch IDLE.</p>
			<p>You can think of IDLE as a notepad or a place where we write
			Python programs.</p>
			<p>Click on File, then New File, and boom! You get a fresh new
			place where you can write your code.</p>
			<p>The other window is where we'll see the output of our program.
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-6">
			<div class="concept-title">What Is the Error?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Here is our program design: We're
			going to start by opening a browser and playing a song. Google how
			to open a web browser in Python. You'll discover a function called
			<code>webbrowser.open</code>. This function takes in the link you
			want to open:</p>
			<p><code>webbrowser.open("http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/vikingkittens)</code></p>
			<p>Save the program and run it. Call it <code>break_time.py</code>.
			</p>
			<p>To run it, click run then click run module.</p>
			<p>When we run it, we get an error: <code>EOL while scanning
			string literal</code>. Python highlights the error in your code.
			It seems like we missed the closing quote. So, add that and run
			the program to see if it works.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Squashing The Bug</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Another error: <code>NameError:
			name 'webbrowser' is not defined.</code></p>
			<p>Python is having difficulty understanding what
			<code>webbrowser</code> is. We can fix this by saying
			<code>import webbrowser</code> at the top. This is our way of
			telling Python &quot;we want to use <code>webbrowser</code> and
			all of its functionality in our program.&quot;</p>
			<p>Save &amp; run. This time the program works.</p>
			<p>We can check off one of the things we have to do: Open browser
			and play a song</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Making the Program Wait</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Next, we will attempt to make our
			program wait for a certain period of time.</p>
			<p>To find out about this, go back to Google, and search &quot;
			python make my program wait.&quot; One of the first links is a
			website called stackoverflow.com. This will soon become one of
			your favorite websites as a programmer. It suggests to use
			something called <code>time.sleep</code> which suspends the
			program for a given number of seconds.</p>
			<p>Back to the program. Since we're still in the testing phase
			we'll try to suspend the program for only 10 seconds: Add <code>
			time.sleep(10)</code> above the <code>webbrowser.open line</code>.
			</p>
			<p>We also have to import the <code>time</code> module: add <code>
			import time</code> to the top of the program.</p>
			<p>Save &amp; run. It seems to be working.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-9">
			<div class="concept-title">Adding a Loop</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The next thing we have to do is to
			put our two steps in a loop so our program can prompt the user to
			take a break multiple times during the day.</p>
			<p>Try and add a loop to this code so it prompts the user to take
			3 breaks.</p>
<pre><code>import time
import webbrowser

counter = 0
while counter &lt; 3:
	time.sleep(10)
	webbrowser.open("http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/vikingkittens")
	counter = counter + 1</code></pre></div>
		</div>

	   <div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-10">
			<div class="concept-title">Adding a Loop Solution</div>
			<div class="concept-content">
<pre><code>import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 3
break_count = 0
while break_count &lt; total_breaks:
	time.sleep(10)
	webbrowser.open("http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/vikingkittens")
	break_count = break_count + 1</code></pre>
			<p>Another handy addition can be a <code>print</code> statement
			that tells us when our program began:</p>
			<p>Add this line above the while loop: <code>print ("This program
			started on "+time.ctime())</code></p>
			<p>Now, when we run the program, we get a prompt stating when we
			started the program. 10 seconds after that, a video is played.
			Another 10 seconds and another suggestion to take a break.</p>
			<p>If you want to stop the program midway, you can restart IDLE or
			use control+c in the shell window, which will stop the execution
			of the program when it comes back from sleep.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-11">
			<div class="concept-title">Making the Program Wait Longer</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Our program is lacking one more
			thing: Lets say we want to prompt the user to take a break every
			two hours on the computer.</p>
			<p>We could change the <code>sleep</code> function to <code>sleep(
			2*60*60)</code>, but since we're still testing our program, we'll
			keep the wait time at 10 seconds.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-12">
			<div class="concept-title">Where Does Webbrowser Come From</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Inside the Python Standard Library
			(which we got when we downloaded Python) is a file called <code>
			webbrowser</code>, and inside <code>webbrowser</code> is a
			function called <code>open</code>. This is the function that
			allowed us to play the video.</p>
			<p>Much like <code>webbrowser</code>, there is another file or
			module inside the Python Standard Library called <code>time</code>.
			 <code> time</code> has several functions defined inside of it.
			 Two of them are <code>ctime</code>, which gives you the current
			 time, and <code>sleep</code>, which suspends program animation
			 for a little bit.</p>
			<p>Here's a thought: How the function <code>sleep</code> actually
			pauses program flow for a given number of seconds, we don't really
			know. In much the same way, how the function <code>open</code>
			actually opens up a web browser, we don't quite know how it does
			that behind the scenes either. That detail is hidden from us.</p>
			<p>This hiding of detail in programming is called <em>Abstraction
			</em>. This idea of abstraction is a really powerful one in
			programming because it allows us to focus on the program that we
			actually want to write. It empowers us to use these functions
			simply by reading their documentation.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-13">
			<div class="concept-title">Reading Webbrowser Documentation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"> <p>Google &quot;python standard
			library &quot; &amp; get to this documentation page: <a target="_blank" href="
			https://docs.python.org/2/library/"> https://docs.python.org/2/library/</a></p>
			<p>Check to make sure you are reading documentation for the
			version of Python you downloaded.</p>
			<p>On the page, you can scroll down to <code>webbrowser</code>.</p>
			<p>You will notice that is says here &quot;The
			<code>webbrowser</code> module provides a high-level interface to
			allow displaying Web- based documents to users,&quot; which is
			really a fancy way of saying
			&quot;it will show you web sites.&quot;</p>
			<p>If you scroll down, you can find the function <code>webbrowser.
			open</code>, which takes in a url and displays that url using the
			default browser.</p>
			<p>If we go back, we can also find the module named
			<code>time</code>. If you click on it, you can read its
			documentation. It says &quot;This module provides various time-
			related functions. &quot; We used two of those functions. If you
			scroll down, you'll find <code>time.ctime</code>, which gives the
			current time of the computer, and <code>time.sleep</code>, which
			&quot;suspend[s] execution for a given number of seconds.&quot;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-14">
			<div class="concept-title">Course Map</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We've just seen one example of how
			functions can help us design the Take a Break program. Lets see
			another example of how functions can help make things easier.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-15">
			<div class="concept-title">Secret Message (Story)</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Kunal and his friends play a lot
			of pranks on each other, and today he was on the receiving end of
			one. This morning, he could not find his house keys. Just then, he
			got a text message from a friend: &quot;We have hidden your house
			keys, to find them, you have to solve a puzzle. On your computer,
			there is a folder with several photos. If you rename all the files
			by removing the numbers from the filename, the photos will reveal
			a secret message and lead you to the house keys.&quot; Renaming 50
			files will take a long time.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-16">
			<div class="concept-title">Secret Message (Output)</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Here Kunal has a folder on his
			computer with a bunch of photos. The message in these photos is
			all jumbled up, we can't quite read it just yet. If you zoom in to
			these photos, you'll notice that the names of the photos have
			numbers in them. Its our task to remove those numbers.</p> <p>
			Kunal wrote a program that does just that. Run it &amp; if you
			look at the folder again, you'll notice that the photos have been
			renamed. Their names don't have any numbers in them anymore. If
			you zoom out, you'll notice that the photos are now revealing a
			message. In this case its just &quot;some secret message.&quot;
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-17">
			<div class="concept-title">Planning a Secret Message</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What steps would you take to
			rename a bunch of files on your computer?</p>
			<p>One way of doing this:</p>
			<p>We have to write a program that looks at the right folder and
			gets all of the filenames from that folder.</p>
			<p>1. Get all the filenames.</p>
			<p>Once we have all the filenames, what we want the program to do
			is rename those files.</p>
			<p>2. For each file, rename it.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-18">
			<div class="concept-title">Opening a File</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>To follow this example, download
			the zip file in the instructor notes. When you unzip that file,
			you'll have a folder with about 50 photos. Create a new file in
			IDLE called <code>rename_files.py</code>. Inside that file create
			an empty function <code>def rename_files():</code>. Then, add
			comments of the two main things we have to do:</p>
			<p><code>#1 get file names from a folder</code></p>
			<p><code>#2 for each file rename filename</code></p>
			<p>Notice that the function right now is empty. If you save and
			run the program, it would essentially do nothing.</p>
			<p>The first thing we have to do is get the file names from a
			given folder. Google can help with that: Search &quot;file names
			in a folder in Python.&quot;&quot; Stack Overflow says that there
			is this thing called <code>os.listdir()</code> which will get you
			everything thats in a given directory. There is a module in Python
			called <code>os</code>, short for operating system, and it has a
			function called <code>listdir</code> which lists everything thats
			in a given directory.</p>
			<p><code>os.listdir</code> takes in the path of the folder that
			contains our photos. So, go back to your folder, copy its path
			address and paste it in <code>os.listdir()</code>. Be sure to put
			it between double quotes. On a Windows machine, right before where
			the path begins, add the letter <code>r</code>. <code>r</code>
			stands for raw path. It tells Python &quot;take this string as it
			is, and don't interpret it any other way&quot; Save this in a
			variable.</p>
			So now we have:
<pre><code>import os
def rename_files():
	#1 get file names from a folder
	file_list = os.listdir(r"C:\Users\Lacy\Dropbox\School\Intro To
	Programming\prank")
	print(file_list)
	#2 for each file rename filename
rename_files()</code></pre>
			<p>Run the program and the output is a list of filenames in Python
			list format.</p></div>

			we add functions to it. Functions like <code>def do_this</code> or
			<code>def do_that</code>. Essentially what we are doing is writing
			code one line at a time, almost like a recipe. Frankly, that
			technique has been working for us thus far. Lets try to use
			functions to write our movie website.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-2-27">
			<div class="concept-title">When Functions Do Not Suffice</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets assume we want to make a
			movie website. If we were to make this based on what we've been
			doing thus far, what we would do is start with an empty
			programming file and call it something like <code>movies.py</code>.
			</p>
			<p>Since a movie has a lot of data associated with it, like the
			title, its storyline, we would add that to our program. Also, we
			would want to do things with our movies. Like, show the movie's
			trailer or show or print all of the movie's information. So, we'd
			add those functions to our code as well.</p>
			<p>Further imagine that we want to run this program and show a
			movie trailer. But which movie's trailer. We'd have to provide the
			function some information like the movie title and trailer url.</p>
			<p>Now lets try to print out a movie's information. We would have
			to supply some information or arguments to the function: The
			movie's title, date, storyline, release date rating, youtube url,
			director, box office, etc. This function is already getting too
			convoluted. Imagine what happens if we have to supply more
			information to it, like the cast, or the movie's reviews.</p>
			<p>What we really want to do is define a template for our movie,
			and record all of the data that needs to go into that template.
			Then we can say show me Toy Story's information, or Avatar's
			trailer, no arguments necessary. One way of doing this, just by
			using functions, is to take the template we've defined and make
			multiple copies, one for each movie.</p>
			<p>This doesn't seem like a very smart solution. Imagine what
			happens if we have to add more pieces of data to our template or
			if we have to rename one of our functions. If that happens, we
			will have to make those changes in each and every copy that we made
			. That doesn't seem like a very smart thing to do.</p>
			<p>What we really need is a way of making copies of a template
			without having multiple files. We need the ability to define a
			template for something, like we did for movies, and then be able
			to say &quot;Toy Story is a type of that template, and so is
			Avatar .&quot; We need something new. That new thing in
			programming is called a <em>class</em>.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-title">Drawing a Square</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Time to draw the square, but this
			time using the computer.</p>
			<p>I (Kunal) created a new Python file and called it <code>
			mindstorms.py</code>. In the file, I created a function called
			<code>draw_square():</code>, which for now is empty.</p>
			<p>I know there is this module in Python called <code>turtle</code>
			. So, <code>import turtle.</code> This is the actual thing that
			moves around and draws stuff on the computer. (I encourage you to
			find out why this thing is called turtle and not dog or cat.)</p>
			<p>One way to start to draw is by saying
			<code>turtle.Turtle()</code> in our function definition. This
			syntax is a little weird and we will understand it by the end of
			this video. Suffice to say that this is how we &quot;grab&quot; a
			turtle. I will call it brad: <code>brad = turtle.Turtle()</code>
			</p>
			<p>The first thing we want to do is move <code>brad</code> forward.
			 We can use the forward function for that:
			<code>brad.forward(100)</code>. This function takes in a number
			which is the distance we want to move forward. I just want to run
			this program to see if its working.</p>
			<p>The one thing we forgot is that we still don't have a screen on
			which this turtle, aka <code>brad</code> is going to move around.
			That is done by adding a window screen:</p>
			<p><code>window = turtle.Screen()</code></p>
			<p>This window is going to have a red background:</p>
			<p><code>window.bgcolor(&quot;red&quot;)</code></p>
			<p>And I want to exit the window any time I click on it:</p>
			<p><code>window.exitonclick()</code></p>
			<p>So we have:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

def draw_square():
	window = turtle.Screen()
	window.bgcolor(&quot;red&quot;)
	brad = turtle.Turtle()
	brad.forward(100)

	window.exitonclick()

draw_square()</code></pre>
			<p>Lets save &amp; run it. It seems that we have a window with a
			red background and a turtle named <code>brad</code> which has
			moved 100 steps forward.</p>
			<p>Back at the code:</p>
			<p>Now I'm going to finish making the square. After
			<code>brad</code> has moved 100 steps forward, I want to turn it
			right by 90 degrees. I can say <code>brad.right(90)</code>.</p>
			<p>Because I want to do these two steps here:</p>
			<p><code>brad.forward(100)</code></p>
			<p><code>brad.right(90)</code></p>
			<p>Four times to draw a square, I'll just copy &amp; past them a
			few times.</p>
			<p>So now we have:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

def draw_square():
	window = turtle.Screen()
	window.bgcolor(&quot;red&quot;)
	brad = turtle.Turtle()
	brad.forward(100)
	brad.right(90)
	brad.forward(100)
	brad.right(90)
	brad.forward(100)
	brad.right(90)
	brad.forward(100)
	brad.right(90)

	window.exitonclick()

			<code>Turtle</code> (with an upper case T.) This is a little
			different than what we have seen thus far. What we have done so
			far is some sort of file like <code>webbrowser</code>, that has
			some sort of a function, like <code>open</code>. We haven't seen
			this thing called a class.</p>
			<p>What is a class? For now you can think of a class as a neatly
			packaged box that puts things together really well. It allows us
			to write code like <code>turtle.Turtle()</code> with these strange
			looking brackets as if we were calling a function.</p>
			<p>In fact, when we do run this piece of code, we are in fact
			calling a function. A function called <code>__init__</code> which
			is defined inside the class <code>Turtle</code>.
			<code>__init__</code> stands for initialize, and what it does is
			creates space in memory for a new instance or a new object of the
			class <code> Turtle</code>. This instance we called
			<code>brad</code>. <code> brad</code> can now access all of the

			<p>Is repeated four times. He doesn't use any sort of a loop.
			Second, the name of his function is <code>draw_square</code>,

			credit I added a triangle)</p>:
<pre><code>import turtle

def draw_square():
	window = turtle.Screen()

			<p>Kunal (the instructor) made these changes:</p>
			<p>In the draw_square function, he now uses a loop. This loop does
			his repetitive tasks, like move the turtle forward, turn right.
			This loop runs 4 times.</p>
			<p>Then, he created a new function called <code>draw_art</code>.
			In this function he creates the window screen, with the background
			color as red. Then he creates his first turtle, named
			<code>brad</code>, he changes <code>brad's</code> shape, color and
			speed, and then he calls the <code>draw_square</code> function, so
			that he can actually draw his first square. After that, he creates
			his second turtle, <code>angie</code>. He changes her shape and
			color. Then <code>angie</code> draws a circle.</p>
			<p>Towards the end he calls the <code>draw_art</code> function.</p>
			<p>Here is his code:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

			<div class="concept-title">What Is a Class?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Before we continue with this
			project, I (Kunal) want to highlight a few new words that we've
			used in the code thus far.</p>
			<p>We've identified Turtle as a class, and <code>brad</code> and
			<code>angie</code> as instances of that class. I want to take a
			moment and talk about these new words.</p>
			<p>You can think of a Class as a blueprint of a building. A
			blueprint contains certain pieces of information about the building
			. For instance, the height of the building, the number of rooms in
			the building, we also know that the same blueprint can be used to
			build multiple different buildings. For instance an office with
			yellow walls and a residential complex with blue walls.</p>
			<p>Lets take the example of class <code>Turtle</code>. The class
			<code>Turtle</code> contains certain pieces of information about
			the turtle. The turtle's size, its color, the fact that the turtle
			can move forward and turn right. From this class or blueprint, we
			can create multiple different instances of that class. For
			example, <code>brad</code> is an instance of class
			<code>Turtle</code> that draws a yellow square, and
			<code>angie</code> is also an instance of class <code>Turtle</code>
			that draws a blue circle.
			</p>
			<p>In summation, you can think of a class as a blueprint. You can
			think of its objects as examples or instances of that blueprint.
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3a-13">
			<div class="concept-title">Making a Circle out of Squares</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Back at the code. For now what I
			will do is continue to draw the square, but comment the rest of
			the code out. If you remember the original challenge, it was to
			draw a circle out of squares. Thus far, all we have done is draw
			just the one square.</p>
			<p>Given that, here's a question for you: How would you build on
			the code thus far to draw the circle out of squares image?</p>
			<p>1. Draw a square.</p>
			<p>2. Rotate right 10 degrees.</p>
			<p>3. Draw a square.</p>
			<p>4. Repeat until you've reached 360 degrees.</p>
			<p>One way of doing this is to draw a square, then turn a little
			to the right, then draw another square. Then turn a little to the
			right again, and then draw another square, and keep doing that.
			Lets build that.</p>
			<p>Here's the piece of code that draws the square: <code>
			draw_square(brad)</code>, and after I've done that what I want is
			the turtle to turn a little bit to the right. Add <code>brad.right(
			10)</code> after the <code>draw_square(brad)</code> line. Because
			I want these two statements to happen over and over again, I will
			put them inside a loop: <code>for i in range(1,5):</code> Save
			&amp; run. The program will draw 4 squares as specified. All I
			have to do is let the turtle keep going around the circle, which
			has 360 degrees. This loop should run 36 times instead: <code>for
			i in range(1,37)</code>. Save &amp; Run. The program draws a
			circle out of squares.</p>
			<p>Here is the final program:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

def draw_square(some_turtle):
		for i in range(1,5):
			some_turtle.forward(100)
			some_turtle.right(90)

def draw_art():
		window = turtle.Screen()
		window.bgcolor(&quot;red&quot;)
		brad = turtle.Turtle()
		brad.shape(&quot;turtle&quot;)
		brad.color(&quot;yellow&quot;)
		brad.speed(2)
		for i in range(1,37):
				draw_square(brad)
				brad.right(10)

		window.exitonclick()

draw_art()</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3a-14">
			<div class="concept-title">They Look So Similar</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Now that we've used classes for
			the very first time, I want to highlight something that took me a
			really long time to understand. When we wanted to use functions
			previously, we wrote code like <code>webbrowser.open</code>. But
			when we wanted to create instances of class <code>Turtle</code>,
			we wrote code that said <code>turtle.Turtle</code>. Look at both
			of these statements: <code>webbrowser.open</code> and <code>turtle.
			Turtle</code>. They look rather similar. It seems like we're
			calling a function in both of these cases. But, something
			different is happening behind the scenes.</p>
			<p>When we call <code>webbrowser.open</code>, all we are doing is
			calling a function. When we call <code>turtle.Turtle</code>, the
			<code>__init__</code> function inside class <code>Turtle</code>,
			thats the function that gets called, and it creates or initializes
			space in memory for a new instance which we called
			<code>brad</code>. Even though it seems like we called functions
			in both cases, we called open in the first case and the function
			<code>__init__</code> in the second. Not all functions are created
			equal. When we called <code>webbrowser.open</code>, all we did was
			call a function. When we called <code>turtle.Turtle</code> it in
			turn called the <code>__init__</code> function, which created or
			initialized space in memory that did not exist before.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-title">Send Text Messages (Story)</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We've all used our phones to send
			out text messages. But sometimes, there is a need for code to send
			texts. Consider the following: Taxi companies send out text
			messages to their passengers informing them of the cab driver's
			location. Dating websites help potential couples communicate with
			each other while using texts but without sharing phone numbers. To
			make authentication more secure, Gmail sends its users a security
			code via text message. Retail organizations communicate daily
			deals to their customers while using texts. This use case seems
			important to a lot of different companies. But, what does it have
			to do with classes and objects?</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Send Text Messages (Output)</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>So I (Kunal) wrote this program
			that sends out text messages. Here is the phone were I want to
			recieve my text message. Let me just go ahead and run my code. It
			works! New text message! Lets build this program.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Introducing Twilio</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Our goal is to send a text message
			using code. I know of a Python package that does exactly that. Its
			called Twilio. Twilio does not come with the Python Standard
			Library. Twilio is one of the thousands of external Python
			packages that are available for you to download and use. There is
			a link in the instructor notes that points out some of the more
			popular external Python packages. For now, download and install
			Twilio.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Setting Up Our Code</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lets begin writing code. The first
			thing I've done is created a new file called
			<code>send_text.py</code>. If you go to Twilio's installation
			page, if you scroll down on this page, you will notice that Twilio
			has provided some sample code that allows us to send text messages
			to our phone. I just want to run it and see if this code actually
			works. If the code works, only then will I try to understand how
			it actually sends a text message to our phone. For now I'm going
			to copy and paste the code to my <code>send_text</code> file.</p>
<pre><code># Download the twilio-python library from http://twilio.
com/docs/libraries from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient

# Find these values at https://twilio.com/user/account
account_sid = "ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
auth_token =  "99xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
client = TwilioRestClient(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(to="+19999999999", from_="+18888888888",
									 body="Hello there!")
print message.sid</code></pre>
			<p>It seems that the code is importing <code>Twilio</code>,
			although it is a little different than we have seen thus far.
			There is the keyword <code>from</code> on the first line, which we
			haven't seen before. I will return to this later. The next two
			lines in the program talk about <code>account_sid</code> and <code>
			auth_token</code>. These are for Twilio to figure out who I am,
			like a user name and password. Next, we'll go to the Twilio
			website and find out those two values.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-5">

			https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio</a>. Twilio wants your cell
			phone number, which you should provide. Then, Twilio texts you a
			verification code. Enter it. Twilio will now give you a phone
			number. Find the link to go to your account and you'll find the
			<code>account_sid</code> and <code>auth_token</code>. Copy those
			into your program.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Running Our Code</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Back at the code. We've pasted
			both the <code>account_sid</code> and <code>auth_token</code> into
			the program. The next thing I want to change is the body of the
			text message. Replace it with something you like. For the
			<code>to</code> number, replace it with your phone number, the one
			you used when you registered for Twilio. The <code>from</code>
			number needs to be replaced with your Twilio number. If you don't
			remember it, go back to the Twilio web page. Save and run. It
			works! Text message received!</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Python Keyword From</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Now that our code works, lets
			figure our whats actually going on with the program. The first
			thing that stands out is the first line of code, which is: <code>
			from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient</code>. So far, we've
			been doing statements like <code>import turtle</code>. Here we
			have a new word: <code>from</code>.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Investigating the Code.</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The best way to find out about
			anything is to Google it. Type in &quot;Python keyword from.&quot;
			Go here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm.</a>
			It says &quot;Python's <code>
			from</code> statement lets you <code>import</code> specific
			attributes from a module&quot; So, it lets you say
			<code>from</code> module or filename <code>import</code> something.
			 <code> from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient</code>. This code
			 means we want to <code>import</code> <code>TwilioRestClient</code>
			  <code> from</code> <code>twilio.rest</code>. What are
			<code>twilio.rest</code> and <code>TwilioRestClient</code>? Go
			back to Google. Enter &quot;Twilio Python Code.&quot; Go to the
			website called github. Here, you can read all of the code that
			makes Twilio work behind the scenes. In the code, you'll find a
			folder <code>twilio</code>. Open it. In that folder is another
			folder called <code> rest</code>. In <code>rest</code>, there is a
			Python file, which if you look through, you will find a class
			called <code> TwilioRestClient</code>. So when we write this line
			of code, <code> from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient</code>,
			we're telling the computer: in <code>twilio</code>, there is a
			folder called <code> rest</code>, and in that folder is a class
			called <code> TwilioRestClient</code> , and we are going to use
			that class in our code.</p>
			<p>If we were writing the code from scratch, we
			probably wouldn't have written this line of code: <code>from twilio
			.rest import TwilioRestClient</code>. We would have said
			<code>from twilio import rest</code>. With that line, we are
			telling the computer &quot;In the folder <code>twilio</code> is
			another folder <code>rest</code>, import that because we are going
			to use it. &quot; We know that in the folder <code>rest</code> is
			the class <code>TwilioRestClient</code>. You would now access that
			class by saying <code>rest.TwilioRestClient</code>. Make those
			changes, save &amp; run, and see if it works. It does!
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-9">
			<div class="concept-title">Where Does Twilio Come From?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>When we downloaded Twilio, we got
			a folder called <code>Twilio</code>. In that folder is a folder
			called <code>rest</code>. In <code>rest</code> is a Python file
			with a class called <code>TwilioRestClient</code>. When we say
			<code>rest.TwilioRestClient()</code>, what were really doing is
			calling the <code>__init__</code> function defined in the class.
			That creates an instance. We call that instance <code>client</code>
			. Then we do a bunch of stuff with that instance, like send a text
			message.</p>
			<p>We know that <code>TwilioRestClient</code> is a class, and
			we've seen another class before, which is class <code>Turtle</code>
			. Are there any similarities between these classes?</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3b-10">
			<div class="concept-title">Connecting Turtle and Twilio</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We've seen two examples of
			classes, one where we drew shapes using turtles, and the other,
			where we sent out text messages using Twilio.</p>
			<p>When we drew shapes using turtle, we wrote a line that
			<code>brad = turtle.Turtle().</code> What that line of code means
			is &quot;in Python, there is a file called <code>turtle</code>,
			and in that file is a class called <code>Turtle</code>.&quot; When
			we access that class using <code>brad = turtle.Turtle()</code>,
			what we are really doing is calling the <code>__init__</code>
			function defined in the class. <code>__init__</code> initializes
			or creates space in memory for a new instance which we called
			<code>brad</code>. <code>brad</code> is an object or instance of
			the class <code>Turtle</code>. This instance <code>brad</code> can
			then do things defined in the class <code>Turtle</code> , like
			move forward or turn right.</p> <p>Similarly, in Twilio, when we
			write a line of code that says
			<code>client = rest.TwilioRestClient()</code> what we are saying
			is that in <code>Twilio</code>, there is a folder called
			<code>rest</code>. In that folder is a Python file that has a
			class called <code>TwilioRestClient()</code>. When we call this
			line of code, <code>client = rest.TwilioRestClient()</code>, what
			we are really doing is calling a function <code>__init__</code>
			defined in the class <code>TwilioRestClient</code>. Again,
			<code>__init__</code> initializes or creates space in memory for
			an object or instance of that class <code>TwilioRestClient</code>.
			We call that object <code>client</code>. The object
			<code>client</code> can now do things defined in
			<code>TwilioRestClient</code> like send sms or text.</p> <p>You
			can think of a class as a blueprint of a building. The blueprint
			will have certain information about the building: Number of rooms,
			Area under the building, etc. We can use the same blueprint to
			build multiple buildings. Like a residential complex with yellow
			walls and an office building with blue walls. Similarly, a class,
			like class <code>Turtle</code>, has information about the turtle:
			How to make the turtle move forward, How to make the turtle turn
			right, etc. We can use one class as a blueprint or template to
			create multiple instances, like
			<code>brad</code> and <code>angie</code>. These instances can do
			things defined in our class. Things like move forward, turn right,
			and draw a circle.</p>
			<p>Recently, we've seen another class:
			<code>TwilioRestClient</code>. This class has information about
			how to connect with Twilio and send a text message. From this
			blueprint, we can create an instance called <code>client</code>.
			<code>client</code> can then do things defined in the class, like
			send out text messages.
			</p>
			<p>Think of a class as a blueprint, which has some basic
			information defined in it. Think of its objects as examples or
			instances of that blueprint.</p></div>

			company asking for volunteers to help him proofread some marketing
			documents. Since I had some time available, I replied by saying
			&quot;I can take a shot at it.&quot; At least, that is what I
			wanted to say. I misspelled one key word in that sentence and
			instead wrote something really embarrassing: &quot;I can take a
			sh*t at it.&quot; Why do the i and o keys have to be so close to
			each other? I was so embarrassed. I wish my spell checker caught
			curse words to alert clumsy writers like myself.</p>
			<p>Lets write a program that detects curse words in a text.</p>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-4">
			<div class="concept-title">One Way of Doing Things</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>There are two main steps to making
			this work:</p>
			<p>1. Read text from a document.</p>
			<p>2. Check the text for curse words.</p>
			<p>Lets begin by reading text from a document.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Reading from a File</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Our plan for the project: Start
			with step 1, reading text. In the instructor notes is the file we
			want to check for curse words. It has some famous movie quotes.
			The file could have contained some other text, like the text of an
			email. The file is named movie_quotes.txt. Feel free to use any
			other text file.</p>
			<p>Lets start writing code. Create a file called
			<code>check_profanity.py</code>. In the file, create a function
			called <code>def read_text():</code>. There is a function in
			Python called <code>open</code>, which lets you work with files on
			your computer. This function takes in the address or the location
			of the file you want to open. On a windows machine, browse to your
			file, copy its location, paste that, then add the filename you
			want to open (don't forget the double quotes):</p>
			<p>open(&quot;C:\path\to\file\movie_quotes.txt&quot;)</p>
			<p>If you're on a Mac, there is a document in the instructor notes
			that will show you how to get the location of a file.</p>
			<p>Refer to the file as <code>quotes</code>:</p>
			<p><code>quotes = open(&quot;C:\path\movie_quotes.txt&quot;)</code>
			</p>
			<p>Now that we have a way to access our file, we'll use a function
			called <code>read</code>.</p>
			<p><code>quotes.read()</code></p>
			<p>This will allow us to read the contents of movie_quotes.txt.</p>
			<p>Save that in a variable called <code>contents_of_file</code>:
			</p>
			<p><code>contents_of_file = quotes.read()</code></p>
			<p>Print out the contents:</p>
			<p><code>print(contents_of_file)</code></p>
			<p>Its also a good convention to close any file we've opened with
			a program:</p>
			<p><code>quotes.close()</code></p>
			<p>So now our program is:</p>
<pre><code>def read_text():
	quotes = open(&quot;C:\path\to\file\movie_quotes.txt&quot;)
	contents_of_file = quotes.read()
	print(contents_of_file)
	quotes.close()
read_text()</code></pre>
			<p>Save and run. The output is all of the movie quotes we read
			from the text file.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Where Does Open Come From?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Where would you place
			<code>open</code> in our model of the Python Standard Library?
			Would it be inside <code>os</code> or would it be in a space all
			by itself or would it be outside the Python Standard Library?</p>
			<p>The first thing to notice about <code>open</code> is that we
			did not say <code>import</code> anything in our code. When we used
			a function like <code>rename</code>, we typed
			<code>import os</code>. But not with <code>open</code>. This is
			because functions like <code>open</code> are so commonly used in
			Python, that they are always available. So, <code>open</code> goes
			in a space all by itself in the Python Standard Library.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Reading Open Documentation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Go to the Python Standard Library
			at <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/">http://docs.python.
			org/2/library/</a>. If you scroll down a little, you will come to
			&quot;Built-in Functions.&quot; Click on it. You'll find many
			functions that are always available in Python. One of those
			functions is <code>open</code>. If you click on <code>open</code>,
			the documentation says that it opens a file. Thats exactly what we
			did in our program. If you keep reading, it says that
			<code>open</code> returns &quot;an object of the file type.&quot;
			The word <em>object</em> is very curious. Where have we come
			across this word object before?</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Connecting Turtle and Open</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The Python Standard Library says
			&quot;<code>open</code> returns an object of the file type.&quot;
			The word object is very interesting, because we've seen it before.
			</p>
			<p>Remember when we were drawing squares using the class
			<code>Turtle</code>? We were writing lines of code like this:</p>
			<p><code>brad = turtle.Turtle()</code></p>
			<p>This line meant that <code>brad</code> was an object or
			instance of the class Turtle.</p>
			<p>Similarly, when we write lines like:</p>
			<p><code>quotes = open(file_location)</code></p>
			<p>We are saying that quotes is an object or instance of File.</p>
			<p>What happens when we run:</p>
			<p><code>brad = turtle.Turtle()</code></p>
			<p>A function, <code>__init__</code> is called from inside the
			class <code>Turtle</code>. What that does is create space in
			memory for the object <code>brad</code>.</p>
			<p>In the case of <code>open</code>, even though on the surface it
			looks like we are merely calling a function, if you look deep in
			the code for how <code>open</code> was implemented in Python,
			you'll find that <code>open</code> is calling some
			<code>__init__</code> like function to create an object of file.

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-9">
			<div class="concept-title">Checking for Curse Words</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The next step is to check the text
			we've read for profanity. To do this, Kunal searched the Internet
			and found a website called
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdyl.com">www.wdyl.com</a>.
			Or &quot;What Do You Love.&quot; One of the things it does is it
			can tell us if a word is a curse word or not. If you go to the
			website's profanity link, which is
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=">
			www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=</a> and try out the word shot:
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=shot">
			www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=shot</a>, the website's response is
			false, which means the word shot is not a curse word. If you
			change shot by just one letter, the response is true. You can even
			give this website a sentence or a paragraph. In place of one word,
			type in &quot;I can take a shot at it.&quot; Hit enter, and the
			response is false. If you change one word in that sentence, the
			response is true. All we have to do now is do what we've been
			doing, but using code.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-3c-10">
			<div class="concept-title">Accessing a Website with Code</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Back at the code, Kunal has added
			a function:</p>
			<p><code>def check_profanity(text_to_check):</code></p>
			<p>It takes in one argument, which is the text we want to check
			for profanity.</p>
			<p>There is a module in Python called <code>urllib</code> which
			gets information from the internet. It has a function called
			<code>urlopen</code>, which takes in a link to a website. So,
			we're going to give it the full WDYL url and add the text we want
			to check:</p>
			<p><code>urllib.urlopen(&quot;http://www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=&quot;+text_to_check)</code></p>
			<p><code>urlopen</code> is going to help us make a connection to
			this website. Call this <code>connection</code>.</p>
			<p><code>connection = urllib.urlopen(&quot;http://www.wdyl.com/profanity?q=&quot;+text_to_check)</code></p>
			<p><code>urlopen</code> is very similar to the other function
			we've used, <code>open</code>. <code>open</code> helps us read
			contents from a file on a computer. <code>urlopen</code> helps
			open a connection to a website on the internet. Then, we can do
			things with that connection.</p>
			<p>Things like read a response from that website. We're going to
			read the response from the website, then print the output. After
			you do that, close the connection:</p>
			<p><code>output = connection.read()</code></p>
			<p><code>print (output)</code></p>
			<p><code>connection.close()</code></p>
			<p>Now we need to call the function <code>check_profanity</code>.
			We'll do that after we've successfully read the text of the file
			we want to check. We'll pass in the contents that we read in
			from the file. Add this line to the end of the
			<code>read_text</code> function:</p>
			<p><code>check_profanity(contents_of_file)</code></p>
			<p>So now we have:</p>
<pre><code>def read_text():
	quotes = open(&quot;C:\path\to\file\movie_quotes.txt&quot;)
	contents_of_file = quotes.read()
	print(contents_of_file)
	quotes.close()
	check_profanity(contents_of_file)

	+text_to_check)
	output = connection.read()
	print (output)
	connection.close()
read_text()</code></pre>
			<p>Save &amp; Run. We get an error. We forgot to
			<code>import urllib</code>. Go back to the code and add
			<code>import urllib</code> at the very top. Save &amp; run again.
			This time, the program works! The program's response is false,
			which means the movie quotes have no curse words. Go back to your

			and run your code one more time. Now the response is true, which
			means that there is a curse word in the file.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-content"><p>We started out by creating squares.

			<p>In all three of these examples, we created instances or objects.

			like <code>open</code> and <code>urlopen</code>, and there was no
			class, like we saw with <code>Turtle</code>. Even though on the

		<h2>Stage 3.4a Make Classes-Movie Website</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Course Map</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We started this stage using functions. In stage 3.2, we built a couple of different projects. Then, we came accross a scenario where using functions didn't work really well. This was when we were trying to build a movie website. This led us to stage 3.3, where we were introduced to classes and we built a bunch of different projects using classes. Here, in stage 3.4, we will write our very first class, and we will return to our movie website example.</p>
			<p>The output of the program we are about to build will look like this: A movie website with all of your favorite movies. If you click on one of them, its trailer will play.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-2">
			<div class="concept-title">What Should Class Movie Remember?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We will use classes to build the movie website. Lets begin by recalling what we already know about classes.</p>
			<p>Remember the blueprint analogy? We compared a blueprint to a class. We said a blueprint of a building contains information about the building, like the number of rooms and the height and width of the walls. We can use one blueprint to build several buildings. These buildings we called examples or instances of that blueprint.</p>
			<p>Classes are like a blueprint. We've seen before that a class like <code>Turtle</code> contains information about what a turtle can do: Move forward, Turn right. We used that information to create multiple examples or instances of that class. We called them <code>brad</code> and <code>angie</code>, that drew different shapes.</p>
			<p>We now want to create a class called <code>Movie</code>, which will allow us to create multiple instances of itself, instances like Toy Story and Avatar.</p>
			<p>The next big question is: What data should the class <code>Movie</code> contain?</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Our Take on Class Movie</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Here are the data points that class <code>Movie</code> should remember: title, youtube_trailer, storyline, poster_image.</p>
			<p>That means when we say something like <code>toy_story.storyline</code>, the program will print this: &quot;A story of a boy and his toys that come to life&quot;</p>
			<p>If we say <code>avatar.show_trailer()</code>, the program will play Avatar's youtube trailer.</p>
			<p>In designing the class <code>Movie</code>, we want to remember</p>
			<p>--title</p>
			<p>--storyline</p>
			<p>--poster_image</p>
			<p>--youtube_trailer</p>
			<p>One thing we may want to do with this data is to have a <code>show_trailer()</code> function which opens a movie's youtube trailer.</p>
			<p>Lets turn this design into code.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Defining Class Movie</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Begin with a blank programming file. Name it <code>media.py</code> and save it in a folder called movies.</p>
			<p>To write a new class, use the Python keyword class. Name it <code>Movie()</code>.</p>
			<p><code>class Movie():</code></p>
			<p>The first letter of the name of the class is in upper case. The Google Style Guide for Python suggests that it should be.</p>
			<p>What is the The Google Style Guide for Python? Google it. Go to the fist link <a target="_blank" href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html">https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html</a>. This style guide provides conventions to programmers all over the world. If you scroll down, you will see that there are conventions on everything, from how to name things to how to write comments. Click on the Naming link. You will see that when defining a class name, Google recommends that the first letter be capitalized.</p>
			<p>Back to the code. We've come across one new keyword called class. We are going to come across several new words in this stage. We'll keep listing them so we can go over them later:</p>
			<p>New Vocabulary Words</p>
			<p>--class</p>
			<p>Our class is empty so far. To figure out what to do next, go back to the design. We know that eventually, we want to create multiple instances of the class <code>Movie</code>, like Toy Story and Avatar. We also know that we've previously created instances of class <code>Turtle</code>. Instances like <code>brad</code>. To do that, we had to write a line of code that read <code>brad=turtle.Turtle()</code>. So, we will have to write a line of code like that to create Toy Story, an instance of class <code>Movie</code>.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-5">
			<div class="concept-title">What Happens When</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Go back to the code. Attempt to make an instance of the class <code>Movie</code> the way we did with class <code>Turtle</code>.</p>
			<p>Start by making a new Python file, save the file in the same folder as <code>media.py</code>. Call the file <code>entertainment_center.py</code></p>
			<p>In <code>entertainment_center.py</code>, type the line <code>import media</code>. This tells Python &quot;Here, I want to use the contents of <code>media.py</code>.&quot; Then add this line:</p>
			<p><code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code></p>
			<p><code>media</code> is the name of our previous Python file, and <code>Movie</code> is the name of the class defined in the file <code>media.py</code>.</p>
			<p>We did not need to create a new file, but its good practice to keep your class definition separate from where you call the class.</p>
			<p><code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code></p>
			<p>This line of code is pretty similar to how we created the turtle <code>brad</code>. In both cases we are saying &quot;some module or file name dot a class name.&quot;</p>
			<p>The next thing we have to do is figure out exactly what happens when we run this line of code: <code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code>.</p>
			<p>Remember what happened behind the scenes when we created the turtle <code>brad</code>? A function named <code>__init__</code> is called; it initializes or creates space in memory for the new instance <code>brad</code>.</p>
			<p>We started out by defining a file called <code>media.py</code>. In that file, we defined a class called <code>Movie</code>. Then we wrote a line of code that said <code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code>. What that did was call the <code>__init__</code> function defined in class <code>Movie</code>. That created a new instance called <code>toy_story</code>. The function <code>__init__</code> initializes or creates space in memory for the new instance <code>toy_story</code>. This function <code>__init__</code> is also called a constructor, because it constructs space in memory for the new instance.</p>
			<p>Put constructor and instance on the list of new words:</p>
			<p>New Vocabulary Words</p>
			<p>--class</p>
			<p>--instance</p>
			<p>--constructor</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Defining __init__</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In <code>media.py</code>, go to class <code>Movie():</code>, in it, we'll start to define our <code>__init__</code> function:</p>
			<p><code>def __init__</code></p>
			<p>There is something strange about the function already. There are two underscores on either side of the function name. These underscores are a way for Python to tell programmers that the word <code>__init__</code> is essentially reserved in Python, and that it is a special function or method. What is special about <code>__init__</code> is that it initializes or creates space in memory to remember details like title, storyline and so on for new movies we are about to create.</p>
			<p><code>__init__</code> takes a few pieces of information, or arguments. The first is always the Python keyword <code>self</code>.</p>
			<p><code>def __init__(self)</code></p>
			<p>What is <code>self</code>? <code>self</code> is the object being created.</p>
			<p>So when we run this line: <code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code>, the <code>__init__</code> function gets called, and <code>self</code> is <code>toy_story</code>.</p>
			<p>Lets add the keyword <code>self</code> to our list of new words:</p>
			<p>New Vocabulary Words</p>
			<p>--class</p>
			<p>--instance</p>
			<p>--constructor</p>
			<p>--self</p>
			<p>Go back to the class <code>Movie</code> and keep defining the function <code>__init__</code>. We want <code>__init__</code> to initialize pieces of information like title, storyline, etc. that we want to remember in our class. Here is how to do that:</p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self):
	self.title
	self.storyline
	self.poster_image_url
	self.trailer_youtube_url</code></pre>
			<p>We have to somehow initialize these variables with information <code>__init__</code> is going to receive:</p>
			<p><code>def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube):</code></p>
			<p>Once you've received these four pieces of information as arguments to the <code>__init__</code> function, you can initialize your movie variables:</p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image,trailer_youtube):
	self.title = movie_title
	self.storyline = movie_storyline
	self.poster_image_url = poster_image
	self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube</code></pre>
			<p>One key point before we execute our code. If we go to <code>entertainment_center.py</code> and run this piece of code: <code>toy_story = media.Movie()</code> we'll get an error. When we try to create <code>toy_story</code>, the <code>__init__</code> function gets called, which is looking for several arguments or pieces of information. We are not sending it any information at all. Lets change that.</p>
			<p>The first argument for the <code>__init__</code> function is <code>self</code>, which is added by default in Python. Add in the rest:</p>
<pre><code>toy_story = media.Movie(&quot;Toy Story&quot;,
						&quot;A story of a boy and his toys that come to life&quot;,
						&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/
						 wikipedia/en/1/13/Toy_Story.jpg&quot;,
						&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYz2wyBy3kc&quot;)</code></pre>
			<p>The last thing we're going to do is print Toy Story's storyline:</p>
			<p><code>print(toy_story.storyline)</code></p>
			<p>Save both <code>entertainment_center.py</code> and <code>media.py</code>. Go back to <code>entertainment_center.py</code>. If everything goes right, the program should print out Toy Story's storyline. Run it. It worked! The storyline is printed.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-7">
			<div class="concept-title">What Is Going On Behind the Scenes</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Here is the code for the class Movie:</p>

		self.title = movie_title
		self.storyline = movie_storyline
		self.poster_image_url = poster_image
		self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube</code></pre>
			<p>What happens behind the scenes when we run this line of code:</p>
			<p><code>toy_story=media.Movie(&quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Toys come to life&quot;, &quot;Toy Story Poster Link&quot;, &quot;Toy Story Youtube Link&quot;)</code></p>
			<p>What happens when you create an instance called <code>toy_story</code> by providing those 4 arguments?</p>
			<p>The first thing that happens is the <code>__init__</code> function is called. Values are assigned to variables.</p>
<pre><code>self = toy_story
movie_title = &quot;Toy Story&quot;
movie_storyline = &quot;Toys come to life&quot;
poster_image = &quot;Toy Story Poster Link&quot;
trailer_youtube = &quot;Toy Story Youtube Link&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>Once <code>__init__</code> gets called, and all of these arguments <code>(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube)</code> receive their correct values, all of the variables associated with the instance toy_story get initialized appropriately:</p>
<pre><code>title = &quot;Toy Story&quot;
storyline = &quot;Toys come to life&quot;
poster_image_url = &quot;Toy Story Poster Link&quot;
trailer_youtube_url = &quot;Toy Story Youtube Link&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>At this point, if you try to <code>print(toy_story.storyline)</code>, it prints out the correct value.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-title">What Will Be the Output?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>So far, we've only created one instance of our class <code>Movie</code>. The next thing to do is create another instance of the class, Avatar.</p>
			<p>Go back to your code. Create the instance Avatar by calling <code>media.Movie</code> in <code>entertainment_center.py</code> and supply the arguments:</p>
<pre><code>avatar = media.Movie(&quot;Avatar&quot;,
					&quot;A marine on an alien planet&quot;,

			<p>Next, print out its storyline:</p>
			<p><code>print(avatar.storyline)</code></p>
			<p>Comment out the old print statement:</p>
			<p><code># print(toy_story.storyline)</code></p>
			<p>Save &amp; run. The program prints out the correct storyline: A marine on an alien planet.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4a-9">

		self.storyline = movie_storyline
		self.poster_image_url = poster_image
		self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube</code></pre>
			<p>What goes on behind the scenes when we create the instance <code>avatar</code> by providing these 4 arguments:</p>
			<p><code>avatar = media.Movie(&quot;Avatar&quot;,&quot;A marine on an alien planet&quot;, &quot;Avatar Poster Link&quot;, &quot;Avatar Youtube Link&quot;)</code></p>
			<p>As soon as we run this line of code, the <code>__init__</code> function is called.</p>
<pre><code>self = avatar
movie_title = &quot;Avatar&quot;
movie_storyline = &quot;A marine on an alien planet&quot;
poster_image = &quot;Avatar Poster Link&quot;
trailer_youtube = &quot;Avatar Youtube Link&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>Once <code>__init__</code> gets called and all these variables <code>(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube)</code> get their appropriate values, all of the variables associated with the instance <code>avatar</code> get initialized too:</p>
<pre><code>title = &quot;Avatar&quot;
storyline = &quot;A marine on an alien planet&quot;
poster_image_url = &quot;Avatar Poster Link&quot;
trailer_youtube_url = &quot;Avatar Youtube Link&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>At this point, if you say <code>avatar.storyline</code>, the program will print out the correct value.</p>
			<p>Lets take a step back to tie together some pieces of information. After defining our class <code>Movie</code>, we created two of its instances, <code>toy_story</code> and <code>avatar</code>. When we created each instance, what we were doing behind the scenes was setting aside space for each instance. Within that space, each instance had their own copy of variables. Because these variables are unique to each instance of class Movie, they are called instance variables. Add instance variables to our list of new words:</p>
			<p>New Vocabulary Words</p>

			<p>What we are really doing is changing storyline from being an instance variable accessible via instances like <code>toy_story</code> and <code>avatar</code> to a simple local variable in the function <code>__init__</code>. You will still be able to access the variable <code>storyline</code> from within the function <code>__init__</code>, but not with an instance like <code>avatar</code>. Since we are trying to do that with our print statement, Python will throw an error and say that <code>avatar</code> has no <code>storyline</code>.

First he adds a movie object for <code>school_of_rock</code>, then an object for <code>ratatouille</code>, then <code>midnight_in_paris</code>, and finally <code>hunger_games</code>.</p>
			<p>To turn this into a movie website, you'll need a piece of code that Udacity wrote. The code is called <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code>. This file is available to download in the instructor notes.</p>
			<p>Before we use it, lets see what the file does. The file has a function inside it called <code>open_movies_page</code>. This function takes in a list of movies as input. As output, it creates and opens an html website that shows the movies you gave it.</p>
			<p>What we're going to do next, is use <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code> and its function <code>open_movies_page</code> in our code.</p></div>

			<div class="concept-title">Coding the Movie Website</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>First, download the file <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code> from the instructor notes. Save it in the exact same folder where you created all of your movie instances.</p>
			<p>In <code>entertainment_center.py</code>, we're going to use the <code>fresh_tomatoes</code> file and call the function <code>open_movies_page</code>:</p>
			<p><code>fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page</code></p>
			<p>The function takes in a list or an array of movies. We have a bunch of movies, but we need to put them in a list or array. Define an empty list called <code>movies</code>:</p>
			<p><code>movies = []</code></p>
			<p>To this list, add all of the movies you've created previously.</p>
			<p><code>movies = [toy_story, avatar, apocalypse_now]</code></p>
			<p>Now we can give this list as input to the <code>open_movies_page</code> function. Provide movies as the argument to <code>open_movies_page</code>:</p>
			<p><code>fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies)</code></p>
			<p>Before we save &amp; run, we need to <code>import fresh_tomatoes</code>. Add that to the top of the file. That line of code will only work if <code>fresh_tomatoes.py</code> is in the exact same directory as the current Python file.</p>
			<p>Save &amp; run. Our movies website appears and works!</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Class Variables</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Start by remembering &quot;Instance Variables.&quot; In the case of class <code>Movie</code>, there were several: <code>title</code>, <code>storyline</code>, <code>poster_image_url</code> and <code>trailer_youtube_url</code>. These variables are associated with every instance we create. Both <code>toy_story</code> and <code>avatar</code> have their own copies of these variables. Sometimes we need variables that we want all of our instances to share.</p>
			<p>Consider the variable <code>valid_ratings=[&quot;G&quot;, &quot;PG&quot;, &quot;PG-13&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]</code> this is an array or list of all possible ratings a movie could have. It wouldn't make sense to say &quot;Here are Toy Story's Valid Ratings and here are Avatar's Valid Ratings.&quot; They would be the same for all instances. So, this variable is really associated with the class <code>Movie</code>, and is called a Class Variable.</p>
			<p>Example of a class variable in our class <code>Movie</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Movie():
	valid_ratings=[&quot;G&quot;, &quot;PG&quot;, &quot;PG-13&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]

	def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image,
				 trailer_youtube):
		self.title = movie_title
		self.storyline = movie_storyline
		self.poster_image_url = poster_image
		self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube</code></pre>
			<p>Notice that the variable <code>valid_ratings</code> is defined at the level of the class and is outside of the <code>__init__</code> function.</p>
			<p>Now, go to the bottom of <code>entertainment_center.py</code>. Comment out any print or output statements. Add the line <code>print media.Movie(valid_ratings)</code>. Save &amp; run. A list of valid ratings prints out.</p>
			<p>We used the class name <code>Movie</code> to access this variable. That means all instances of <code>Movie</code> can share the list to see if their individual rating is a valid one.</p>
			<p>The value of <code>valid_ratings=[&quot;G&quot;, &quot;PG&quot;, &quot;PG-13&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]</code> is probably a constant. The value of the variable isn't going to change. When we define a constant, The Google Style Guide for Python recommends that we use all caps to define the variable. So go ahead and make that change. <code>VALID_RATINGS=[&quot;G&quot;, &quot;PG&quot;, &quot;PG-13&quot;, &quot;R&quot;]</code></p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Doc Strings</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In Python, all classes come with some pre-existing class variables. One of them is called <code>__doc__</code>. This variable has two underscores on both sides of it.</p>
			<p>At the Python Shell, <code>import turtle</code>, then input <code>turtle.Turtle.__doc__</code>. We get some documentation on the class Turtle.</p>
			<p>How to use the variable with our class <code>Movie</code>: Add your documentation at the beginning of the class movie:</p>
<pre><code>class Movie():
	&quot;&quot;&quot;This class provides a way to store movie related information.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
			<p>Use triple quotes to define your documentation. Triple quotes let us create documentation that spans multiple lines.</p>
			<p>Go back to your <code>entertainment_center.py</code> file and add the line <code>print (media.Movie.__doc__)</code>. The output when you save and run is the documentation we just wrote for the class <code>Movie</code>.</p>
			<p>Like <code>__doc__</code>, Python has a few more pre-defined variables, including <code>__name__</code> and <code>__module__</code>. <code>__name__</code> is the name of the method. <code>__module__</code> is the name of the module in which the method was defined.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Inheritance</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Think about how we use the word inheritance in English. A child can inherit traits from their parents: Last name, eye color, maybe some money.</p>
			<p>To model this in programming, we would create a class called <code>Parent</code>, which would have attributes like <code>last_name</code> and <code>eye_color</code>. Then we would make a class called <code>Child</code>, which would inherit the attributes of the class <code>Parent</code>. The class <code>Child</code> could have another variable of its own called <code>number_of_toys</code>.</p>
			<p>If we design code like this, we are beginning to reuse code, which is a huge advantage of Object Oriented Programming.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Class Parent</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Create a new Python file called <code>inheritance.py</code></p>
			<p>Based on our design, create a class called <code>Parent</code>: <code>class Parent():</code></p>
			<p>Next, initialize the variables of class <code>Parent</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Parent ():
	def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color):
		self.last_name = last_name
		self.eye_color = eye_color</code></pre>
			<p>To make sure our code works, define an instance of the class <code>Parent</code> at the end of the file:</p>
			<p><code>billy_cyrus = Parent (&quot;Cyrus&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)</code></p>
			<p><code>print (billy_cyrus.last_name)</code></p>
			<p>(Ordinarily, we do this in a separate Python file. For simplicities sake, we're doing it this way just this once)</p>
			<p>Billy Cyrus' last name prints out correctly.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-5">
			<div class="concept-title">What's the Output?</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Now we'll start to define class <code>Child</code>. Class <code>Child</code> inherits from class <code>Parent</code>. The way to indicate that in Python is this:</p>
			<p><code>class Child (Parent):</code></p>
			<p>class <code>Child</code> will now inherit or reuse everything publicly available in class <code>Parent</code>.</p>
			<p>To initialize the variables we are inheriting from class <code>Parent</code>, we reuse class <code>Parent's</code> <code>__init__</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>class Child (Parent):
	def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color, number_of_toys):
		Parent.__init__(self, last_name, eye_color)</code></pre>
			<p>Finally, initialize <code>number_of_toys</code> and our class looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Child (Parent):
	def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color, number_of_toys):
		Parent.__init__(self, last_name, eye_color)
		self.number_of_toys = number_of_toys</code></pre>
			<p>Next, create an instance of the class <code>Child</code> and print out their last name and number of toys:</p>
<pre><code>miley_cyrus = Child(&quot;Cyrus&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, 5)
print(miley_cyrus.last_name)
print(miley_cyrus.number_of_toys)</code></pre>
			<p>So now, our code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Parent ():
	def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color):
		print(&quot;Parent Constructor Called&quot;)
		self.last_name = last_name
		self.eye_color = eye_color

class Child (Parent):
	def __init__(self, last_name, eye_color, number_of_toys):
		print(&quot;Child Constructor Called&quot;)
		Parent.__init__(self, last_name, eye_color)
		self.number_of_toys = number_of_toys

#billy_cyrus = Parent(&quot;Cyrus&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)
#print (billy_cyrus.last_name)

miley_cyrus = Child(&quot;Cyrus&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, 5)
print(miley_cyrus.last_name)
print(miley_cyrus.number_of_toys)</code></pre>
			<p>The first thing we are doing with our code is creating an instance of class <code>Child</code>, called <code>miley_cyrus</code>. As soon as that line runs, the <code>__init__</code> method in class <code>Child</code> is called. The first line in the <code>__init__</code> method is the <code>print</code> statement <code>&quot;Child Constructor Called.&quot;</code> After that, the constructor for the class <code>Parent</code> is called. When the <code>__init__</code> method for class <code>Parent</code> is called, we print out <code>&quot;Parent Constructor Called.&quot;</code> Then the instance variables <code>last_name</code> and <code>eye_color</code> will be initialized. Once the <code>__init__</code> method for class <code>Parent</code> has run, control returns to class <code>Child</code>. The instance variable <code>number_of toys</code> will be initialized. At that point, the <code>__init__</code> method for class <code>Child</code> is done and the instance <code>miley_cyrus</code> has been successfully created.</p>
			<p>Then, the following two print statements run: <code>print(miley_cyrus.last_name)</code></p>
			<p><code>print(miley_cyrus.number_of_toys)</code></p>
			<p>So, our output is:</p>
			<p><code>Child Constructor Called</code></p>
			<p><code>Parent Constructor Called</code></p>
			<p><code>Cyrus</code></p>
			<p><code>5</code></p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Updating the Design for Class Movie</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Inheritance can help us reuse code. In our example, class <code>Child</code> reused code from class <code>Parent</code>. Lets see if we can use inheritance to improve the design of class <code>Movie</code>.</p>
			<p>Previously, we created class <code>Movie()</code>, with the following attributes: <code>title</code>, <code>storyline</code>, <code>poster_image</code>, <code>youtube_trailer</code>. After we defined the class <code>Movie</code>, we created several instances of it, like <code>toy_story</code> and <code>avatar</code>.</p>
			<p>Imagine that we wanted to create another class called <code>TvShow():</code> This class would have details like <code>title</code>, <code>season</code>, <code>episode_number</code> and <code>tv_station</code>. The class could also have a function called <code>get_local_listing()</code>. Once we've created a class called <code>TvShow</code>, we can create multiple instances of it. Instances like Season 1, Episode 1 of Breaking Bad and The Final Episode of Seinfeld.</p>
			<p>There are several items that these two classes can share: Title and Duration in minutes.</p>
			<p>The best way to structure this code would be to create another class called <code>Video():</code>, which would have 2 attributes: <code>title</code> and <code>duration</code>. The class <code>Movie</code> could inherit from class <code>Video</code>. To do this, we would have to add the class name <code>Video</code> inside the parentheses: <code>Movie(Video)</code>. Also, the class <code>TvShow()</code> could also inherit from class <code>Video</code>. We would also have to add the class name <code>Video</code> to <code>TvShow</code>: <code>TvShow(Video)</code>. This would mean that the class <code>TvShow</code> would inherit <code>title</code> and <code>duration</code> from class <code>Video</code>.</p>
			<p>Another big benefit to writing code this way, besides reusing it, is that it allows us to follow an intuitive model of how things exist in our brain. Intuitively speaking, we know what videos are, we also know what TV shows and movies are. Writing code this way lets programmers map how things exist in our brain.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Reusing Methods</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Besides instance variables, inheritance can also help with reusing methods.</p>
			<p>Go back to <code>inheritance.py</code>. Add a function to print out the last name and eye color of the parent:</p>
<pre><code>	def show_info(self):
		print(&quot;Last Name - &quot;+self.last_name)
		print(&quot;Eye Color - &quot;+self.eye_color)</code></pre>
			<p>To see if the method actually works, call the method <code>show_info</code> using the <code>Parent's</code> instance <code>billy_cyrus</code>: <code>billy_cyrus.show_info()</code></p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-3-4b-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Method Overriding</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Go back to your code in <code>inheritance.py</code>. Because class <code>Child</code> inherits from class <code>Parent</code>, the method <code>show_info</code> is also inherited. Instances of class <code>Child</code>, like <code>miley_cyrus</code>, can also call <code>show_info</code>, even though the method isn't explicitly defined in class <code>Child</code>. Add this line after your definition of <code>miley_cyrus</code>: <code>miley_cyrus.show_info()</code>. Save and run. The last name and eye color of the instance <code>miley_cyrus</code> print out.</p>
			<p>The next thing we'll do is create a method called <code>show_info</code> within the class <code>Child</code> that shows all three pieces of information about the child:</p>
<pre><code>	def show_info(self):
		print(&quot;Last Name - &quot;+self.last_name)
		print(&quot;Eye Color - &quot;+self.eye_color)
		print(&quot;Number of toys - &quot;+str(self.number_of_toys))</code></pre>
			<p>When you save and run, the output is all 3 pieces of information. The <code>show_info</code> method from class <code>Child</code> is called, not the one from class <code>Parent</code>.</p>
			<p>What we've done is defined a method with the same name, <code>show_info</code>, in class <code>Child</code> and class <code>Parent</code>. The ability of a subclass to override a method that it inherited from its parent class, is called <em>Method Overriding</em>.</p></div>
