		<h2>Stage 2.1 Introduction to Serious Programming</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-1-1">
			<div class="concept-title">What Computer Science is About</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Computer Science is about how to
			solve problems by breaking them into smaller pieces and then
			precisely and mechanically describing a series of steps that you
			can use to solve each piece, and those steps can be executed by a
			computer.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-1-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Programming</div>
<div class="concept-content"><p>The core of computer science. Most
			machines are designed to do one thing, like a toaster. Without a
			program, a computer is even less useful than a toaster. The
			program tells the computer what to do. The power of a computer,
			unlike a toaster, is that a computer can do anything. Anything we
			can figure out how to write a program for, we can make the
			computer do. A program needs to be a very precise sequence of steps
			. The computer by itself doesn't know how to do anything, it has a
			few simple instructions that it can execute. To make a program do
			something useful, we need to put those instructions together in a
			way that does what we want. The power of the computer is that it
			can execute those steps super fast. The program gives us a way to
			tell the computer what steps to take. There are many different
			languages for programming computers. The language we will be
			learning is called Python. Python gives us a high level language
			to write programs. That means instead of running directly on the
			computer, the programs we write will be input into the Python
			program, which runs on the computer. Python is called an
			interpreter, that means it runs our programs, it interprets them,
			it executes the program that we wrote in the Python language.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-1-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Why We Need Programming Languages</div>
<div class="concept-content"><p>Why do we need to invent new
			languages like Python to program computers, rather that using
			natural languages like English or Mandarin? 1. Ambiguity: Natural
			languages are inherently ambiguous. Different people interpret the
			same sentence different ways. When we program computers we need to
			make sure the computer interprets the language the exact same way
			the programmer does. Example: Biweekly can mean twice a week or
			once every two weeks according to the dictionary. 2.Verbosity.
			Natural languages are very verbose. To write a program we need to
			describe exactly what the computer should do in a very precise
			sequence of steps. If we had to describe all those details using
			natural language, it would require a huge amount of text. With a
			language like Python we only need a few lines of code to describe
			a complex thing in a step by step way. </p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-1-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Grammar</div>
<div class="concept-content"><p>Like English, Python has a grammar
			that defines what strings are in the language. English rule: You
			can make a sentence by combining a subject with a verb &amp; object
			. <em>Backus-Naur Form</em> is a way of writing grammars. The
			purpose is to describe languages in a way that is simple and
			concise. On the left there is a [Non-terminal] (something we
			aren't finished with) then an arrow, and on the right side, a
			replacement. The replacement can be anything, it can be a sequence
			of non-terminals, it can be one non-terminal, it can also be a
			terminal. Once we get to a terminal, there is nothing else we can
			replace it with. We can form a sentence by starting from some non-
			terminal, then by following the rules, we keep replacing non-
			terminals with their replacements until we're left with only
			terminals. Derivation: Starting from non-terminals follow the
			rules to come up with a sequence of terminals. Important thing
			about replacement grammars is that we can describe an infinitely
			large language with a small set of rules.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-1-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Python Grammar</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Python grammar is much stricter
			than English. Ungrammatical speech can still be understood in
			English. In Python, the code must match the language grammar
			exactly. <code> print 2 +</code> gives a syntax error.</p></div>
		</div>

		<h2>Stage 2.2 Variables and Strings</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Variables</div>
			<div class="concept-content">
			<p>Our answer to the last quiz (<code>
			print 299792458 * 100 * 1.0 / 1000000000</code>) would have been a
			lot easier to read and a lot more useful if we used names to keep
			track of values, instead of writing out those big numbers,
			especially numbers as big as the speed of light. Python provides a
			way to do it, its called the variable. We can use a variable to
			create a name and use that name to refer to a variable. Way to
			introduce a variable is using an Assignment Statement: Name =
			Expression. After the Assignment Statement, the name refers to the
			value that the expression has. The name can be any sequence of
			letters and numbers as well as underscores, as long as it starts
			with a letter or underscore. Example: <code>speed_of_light =
			299792458.</code></p>
			<p>When we print speed_of_light, we'll see 299792458. We can use it
			in expressions too: If we want to convert it to centimeters
			instead of meters we can multiply by 100:</p>
			<p><code>print speed_of_light * 100</code> gives the result
			29979245800.</p>
			<p>Another variable: <code>billionth = 1.0 / 1000000000</code>.
			Another: <code>nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100</code>
			(Nanostick is the length light travels in a nanosecond.)
			<code>print nanostick</code> gives the result 29.9792458</p>
			<p>Variables are very useful, they make our programs a lot easier
			to understand. They also mean that we can use the same expression,
			changing the values of the variables to compute different things.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Comments in Python: # from the start of the to the end
			of the line is a comment.</strong></p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Variables Can Vary</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Once we define a variable, we can
			change the value. When we use the variable again, it refers to the
			new value.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>days = 7 * 7</code>  (days now refers to the value 49)</p>
			<p><code>days = 48</code> (days now refers to the value 48)</p>
			<p>We can use variables in their own assignment statements:</p>
			<p><code>days = days - 1</code> (days now refers to the value 47
			)</p>
			<p>We can do the same thing again: <code>days = days -1</code> (
			days now refers to the value 46)</p>
			<p><code>=</code> This is <em>not</em> an equals symbol.
			<code>=</code> means <em>assignment</em> in Python. Think of it as
			an arrow that says put whatever value the right side evaluates to
			into the name on the left side.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Strings</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>In the early days of computing,
			people thought of computers as super powerful calculators for
			doing computations like simulating nuclear weapons, computing
			ballistic tables, or breaking encryption. There is no reason to
			limit computers to numbers: They can operate on any kind of data
			we want and it gets much more interesting when we operate on data
			besides just numbers.</p>
			<p>A string is just a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.
			Example of a string in Python: <code>'I am a string!'</code> If we
			want we can use double quotes instead: <code>"I prefer double
			quotes!"</code> The only requirement is that if we begin with a
			single quote we end with one, the same with double quotes. <code>
			"I'm happy I started with a double quote!"</code></p>
			<p><code>print 'Hello'</code></p>
			<p><code>print "Hello"</code></p>
			<p>Both return the same thing.</p>
			<p>Assigning a string to a variable is just like assigning a number
			to a variable: <code>name = "John"</code></p>
			<p><code>print "Hello " + name</code></p>
			<p>The <code>+</code> operator on strings means something different
			than with numbers. With strings it means concatenation</p>
			<p><code>string + string</code> -&gt;concatenation of the two
			strings.
			[You need to add spacing as necessary to the strings to format
			output.]
			You cannot use the <code>+</code> operator with a string and a
			number [cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects.]
			You <em>can</em> multiply strings: <code>print '!' * 12</code>
			results in 12 exclamation points.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Indexing Strings</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>One of the things we can do with
			strings that we can't do with numbers is extract subsequences from
			the strings.</p>
			<p>If we have a string, we can use the square brackets to extract
			parts of that string:
			<code>&lt;string&gt; [&lt;expression&gt;]</code></p>
			<p><code>'udacity'[0]</code> would extract the 0 character from the
			string. Characters in a string are indexed starting from zero. The
			result of <code>'udacity'[0]</code> is the string <code>'u.'</code>
			</p>
			<p>The expression inside the square bracket can be anything that
			evaluates to a number. <code>'udacity'[1+1]</code> returns <code>'a
			.'</code></p>
			<p><code>name='Dave'</code></p>
			<p><code>name[0]</code> returns <code>'D'</code></p>
			<p>You <em>can</em> use negative numbers, in which case it starts
			counting from the back of the string.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Selecting Subsequences From Strings
			</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p><code>&lt;string&gt;[&lt;expression
			&gt;:&lt;expression&gt;]</code></p>
			<p>The value of the first expression we'll call start, the value of
			the second expression we'll call stop.</p>
			<p>The result is a string that is a subsequence of the characters
			in the string starting from position start and ending with position
			stop but not including that character. So start to stop -1.</p>
			<p><code>word = 'assume'</code></p>
			<p><code>print word[4:6]</code></p>
			<p>returns <code>me</code></p>
			<p><code>print word[4:]</code></p>
			<p>selects from position 4 to the end.</p>
			<p><code>print word[:2]</code></p>
			<p>selects from the beginning</p>
			<p><code>print word [:]</code></p>
			<p>selects the entire string</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Finding Strings in Strings</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The <code>find</code> operation
			gives us a way in a big string to find some substring that we're
			looking for. The way we use <code>find</code> is a little
			different because find is a method (a built in procedure provided
			by Python.)</p>
			<p>Find is a procedure that operates on strings <code>
			&lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;string&gt;)</code> The second string is
			the one we want to find in the first.</p>
			<p>The output of find is the position in the string where that
			substring is found (The first occurrence.) A number that gives the
			first position in the search string where the target string appears
			. If the target string is not found, output will be <code>-1</code>
			.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-2-7">
			<div class="concept-title">Finding with Numbers</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Find returns the first position,
			but there might be other occurrences we want to find.</p>
			<p>The way to find them is to pass a second parameter:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;string&gt;.find(&lt;string&gt;, &lt;number&gt;)</code>
			</p>
			<p>What find will output is the number of the position in the
			search string where the target string first appears at or after
			the <code>&lt;number.&gt;</code></p></div>

		<h2>Stage 2.3 Input-&gt;Function-&gt;Output</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Self Driving Cars</div>
			<div class="concept-content"> <p>Inputs and outputs can be
			incredibly rich. One example is a self driving car. Taking data in
			is essential to making self driving cars work. The machine has a
			lot of sensors that take data in at enormous rates. It has a laser
			range finder on the roof that takes scans 10 times a second of the
			entire surroundings. It has a spherical camera, very much like
			Google Street is able to see in all directions. It has a stereo
			camera system. It also has a GPS system used to localize the car
			course lead based on satellite navigation. So, all this data,
			which are millions and millions of data points per second, get fed
			into the computer system that sits in the cars trunk. It uses that
			data to avoid collisions with bicyclists, cars, pedestrians and so
			on. Finally, the data gets funneled back to the car. These are the
			outputs of the computer system. They actuate the steering wheel,
			they use the brake, the gas.</p></div> </div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Functions [or Procedures]</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>How to use a procedure [function]:
			</p>
			<p><code>&lt;procedure&gt;(&lt;input&gt;, &lt;input&gt;,...)</code>
			</p>
			<p>There can be any number of inputs, but they have to match the
			number of inputs the procedure expects. Inputs are sometimes
			called operands or arguments.</p>
			<p>We've already done something similar to this. In 2.2 we learned
			about using find on strings:</p>
			<p><code>find('au',3)</code></p>
			<p>With find, you would pass in one or 2 inputs. The first input
			was a string (that you were looking for.) The second input could
			be a number (the position where you start looking for that string.)
			 We used find in many ways in stage 2.2.</p>
			<p>Find is a little different from the procedures that you define
			yourself. First of all, its built in. Secondly, instead of just
			having find, we had another input in front of the function, the
			string we were doing the find in, say its the variable
			<code>page</code>:</p>
			<p><code>page.find('au',3)</code></p>
			<p>That is really another input to find. We'll talk later about
			why its done differently. But its very similar to calling a
			procedure where one of the inputs is on the left and the other two
			are on the right.</p>
			<p>For all the procedures you define yourself, we won't have any
			object to invoke them on like the string in find. We'll just have
			the procedure to call and the arguments or operands or inputs to
			pass in.</p>
			<p>How this works with a simple procedure:</p>
			<p><code>def rest_of_string(s):</code></p>
			<div class="tab"><p><code>return s[1:]</code></p></div>
			<p>This will evaluate to the string with the first letter removed.
			</p>
			<p>How to use this procedure:</p>
			<p><code>print rest_of_string('audacity')</code></p>
			<p>What happens when we call a procedure like this: Execution will
			jump into the body of the procedure. What the interpreter is doing
			is jumping to run the code inside the procedure. It will assign to
			the parameters the values passed in as the inputs. Think of it as
			being an assignment that says now the value of <code>s = 'audacity'
			</code>. Now we're going to evaluate the body of the procedure. In
			this case, there's only one statement, the return statement. We're
			going to find the value of <code>s[1:]</code>. The result of that
			is the string <code>'udacity'</code>. Then we get to the return.
			What return means is that we're going to jump back to where we
			called the procedure, but now we actually have a result. So, when
			we jump back, the value that
			<code>rest_of_string('audacity')</code > evaluates to is whatever
			value we returned. In this case, its the string
			<code>'udacity'</code></p>
			<p>Anything we're going to do in the rest of the course, and
			anything almost anyone does in programming is all about defining
			procedures and using procedures. We can think of procedures in
			terms of mapping inputs to outputs.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Making and Using Functions</div>
			<div class="concept-content"> <p>Making a function:</p>
			<p>Start a line of code with the keyword <code>def</code>. Give
			the function a name. Follow the name with the function parameters
			in parentheses. In the main part of the function, write the code
			that says what to do with the parameters.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Def sum(a,b):
	c = a + b
	return c</code></pre>
			<p>Using a function:</p>
			<p>Write the name of the function then the parameters we want to
			input.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>print sum(2,3)</code></p>
			<p><code>5</code></p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Functions Avoid Repetition</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Functions avoid repetition because
			they are infinitely reusable. Once you write a function you can
			use it many times in your code without having to define it again.
			</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Functions Without a Return</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What does this function do?</p>
<pre><code>def sum(a,b):
	a = a + b</code></pre>
			<p>It really does nothing. It doesn't have a return, so it doesn't
			produce any output. It doesn't actually modify the value of the
			first input in any way thats visible to the caller. It does modify
			the value of a, inside the function, but the caller can't actually
			see it.</p>
			<p>The result of the procedure in Python is <code>None</code>.
			Python uses None to mean "there's no value."</p>
			<p>Lets add a return statement:</p>
<pre><code>def sum(a,b):
	a = a + b
	return a
print sum(2, 123)</code></pre>
			<p>Now when we run this, we get the result 125.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-3-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Functions and Variables</div>

print a</code></pre>
			<p>Does the value of <code>a</code> change after running this? No.
			The reason is what gets passed in is the value, not the name of
			the variable. What gets passed in is the value of <code>a</code>,
			in this case 2. We don't actually modify what the variable is.</p>
			<p>More explanation:</p>
			<p><code>a=2</code></p>
			<p><code>b=123</code></p>
			<p>Name <code>a</code> refers to the value 2. Name <code>b</code>
			refers to the value 123.</p>
			<p>Then, we have our procedure:</p>
<pre><code>def sum(a,b):
 a = a + b</code></pre>
			<p>When we call <code>sum</code>, <code>sum(a,b)</code> we have
			the names of our parameters. We're going to have a name inside sum
			called <code>a</code>. That <code>a</code> refers to whatever
			value is passed in when <code>sum</code> is called. <code>a</code>
			refers to the value 2, <code>b</code> refers to the value 123.
			When we run sum, we do the assignment, that is going to produce
			the new number, adding 2 + 123, and we get the value 125. Then we
			do the assignment. The assignment changes what <code>a</code>
			refers to. Now instead of referring to the number 2, the
			<code>a</code> that corresponds to the parameter to the procedure
			sum, now refers to 125.</p>
			<p><em>Note that the original value of <code>a</code>, the one we
			named outside the function, still refers to 2.</em> When we come
			back from the procedure, all the parameters that were visible
			inside the body of sum are no longer visible. They were there for
			that execution, but they're done, we can't use those names any more
			. They were only visible during that execution of the procedure.

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-4-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Making Decisions</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Everything we've had to do so far
			has been pretty limited. We had to do the same thing on all data.
			We couldn't do anything that really depended on what the data was.
			</p>
			<p>What we're going to do next is to figure out a way to make code
			behave differently based on decisions. The first thing we're going
			to do is figure out some ways to make comparisons so we have a way
			to test and decide what we should do.</p>
			<p>Python provides lots of different operators for doing
			comparisons. They're things similar to what we've used in math:
			<code>&lt;</code > we have a less than sign that compares two
			numbers. <code>&gt;</code> we have a greater than.
			<code>&lt;=</code> we have a less than or equal to. All of these
			operate on numbers. We can have a <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>
			followed by a comparison operator > <code>&lt;operator&gt;</code>
			followed by another number <code> &lt;number &gt;</code>. This is
			very similar to the grammar we saw earlier for arithmetic
			expressions, but now instead of having a plus or times we have
			something that does a comparison. The output of a comparison is
			not a number, its a boolean value. A boolean value is one of two
			things: Its either the value <code>True</code> or the value
			<code>False</code>. Note that in Python, the boolean values
			<code>True</code> and <code> False</code> are <em>capitalized</em>.
			</p>
			<p>Examples:</p>
			<p><code>print 2 &lt; 3</code></p>
			<p>The result is <code>True</code></p>
			<p><code>print 21 &lt; 3</code></p>
			<p>The result is <code>False</code></p>
			<p>We can have any expression we want with the comparison:</p>
			<p><code>print 7 * 3 &lt; 21</code></p>
			<p>The result is <code>False</code>, because 7*3 is equal to 21</p>
			<p>Another comparison operator we can use is
			<em>"not equal to."</em></p>
			<p><code>print 7 * 3 != 21</code></p>
			<p>The result is <code>False</code>, because 7*3 is equal to 21.
			</p>
			<p>If we want to do equality comparison, we don't use the equals
			sign, we use two equals signs. We call that the "double equal."</p>
			<p><code>print 7 * 3 == 21</code></p>
			<p>The result is <code>True</code>.</p>
			<p>Why is the equality comparison done using <code>==</code>
			instead of <code>=</code>? Because <code>=</code> means assignment.
			</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>i = 21</code> assigns the value 21 to the variable <code>i
			</code>. <code> i == 21</code> is a comparison, it evaluates to
			either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on
			whether the value of <code >i</code> is 21.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-4-2">
			<div class="concept-title">If Statements</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p><strong>If:</strong></p>
			<p>Now we know some ways to make comparisons, we want to use them
			to make decisions, to make our code do something different
			depending on the result of a comparison. The way to do that is to
			use an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
			<p>The structure of an <code>if</code> statement is we have the
			keyword <code>if</code> followed by a comparison, we'll call that
			the <code>&lt;Test Expression&gt;</code>, followed by a colon.</p>
			<p><code>if &lt;Test Expression&gt;:</code></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p>Then, inside the <code>if</code>, we have the block: The block
			is the code that will run if the test expression is
			<code>True</code>. If the test expression doesn't evaluate to
			<code>True</code> , then the block doesn't execute. As with
			function definitions, we know the end of the <code>if</code>
			because of the indentation. All the statements inside the block
			are executed only when the test expression is <code>True</code>.
			The next statement, that is not indented, is going to be executed
			whether or not the test expression is <code>True</code>.</p>
			<p>Example of a function using an if statement:</p>
<pre><code>def absolute(x):
	if x&lt; 0:
		x = -x
	return x</code></pre>
			<p>What this does is give us the absolute value of the number
			thats passed in.</p>
			<p><strong>Else:</strong></p>
			<p>Start with this:</p>
<pre><code>def bigger(a,b):
	if a &gt; b:
		return a
	return b</code></pre>
			<p>Instead of just having what we had before:</p>
			<p><code>if &lt;Test Expression&gt;:</code></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p>What we want is something that executes when the test
			expression is <code>False.</code></p>
			<p>We can do that by using an <code>else</code>.</p>
			<p><code>if &lt;Test Expression&gt;:</code></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p><code>else:</code></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p>As before, the indentation tells us when we're done with the
			block.</p>
			<p>How to rewrite bigger using else:</p>
<pre><code>def bigger(a,b):
	if a &gt; b:
		return a
	else:
		return b</code></pre>
			<!-- <code>def bigger(a,b):</code><br>
				<div class="tab"><code>if a &gt; b:</code></div>
					<div class="tab-2"><code>return a</code></div>
				<div class="tab"><code>else:</code></div>
					<div class="tab-2"><code>return b</code></div> -->
			<p>This means the same thing as the first function, and in this
			case neither is particularly better. but there are lots of cases
			where it makes things work a lot better by using else.</p>
			<p>One way using else makes things better:</p>
<pre><code>def bigger(a,b):
	if a &gt; b:
		r = a
	else:
		r = b</code></pre>
			<p><strong>Or:</strong></p>
			<p><code>&lt;Expression&gt; or &lt;Expression&gt;</code></p>
			<p>If the first expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, the
			value is <code>True</code> and the second expression is not
			evaluated. If the first expression evaluates to <code>False</code>
			, the value is the value of the second expression.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>def is_friend(name):
	return name[0] == 'D' or name[0] == 'N'
print is_friend('Doug')
print is_friend('Nicole')
print is_friend('Fred')</code></pre>
			<p><code>or</code> gives us the logical <em>or</em> of the two
			operands on its left and right.</p>
			<p>Examples:</p>
			<p><code>print True or False</code></p>
			<p>The value is <code>True</code></p>
			<p><code>print False or True</code></p>
			<p>also has the value <code>True</code></p>
			<p><code>print True or True</code></p>
			<p>is also <code>True</code></p>
			<p><code>print False or False</code></p>
			<p>is <code>False</code></p>
			<p>The one important thing that or does that is different from
			other operators is that it only evaluates what it needs to.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>print True or this_is_an_error</code></p>
			<p>evaluates to <code>True</code></p>
			<p><code>this_is_an_error</code> is an undefined variable, its an
			error. But, when we evaluate the <code>or</code> expression,
			because we already found that the first part was <code>True</code>
			, we don't get an error.</p>
			<p><code>print False or this_is_an_error</code></p>
			<p>In this case, its necessary to evaluate the second operand (
			since the first one is <code>False</code>,) and we'll get an error.

				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p>The block is a sequence of instructions. With <code>if</code>,
			the block is executed 0 or 1 times. With <code>while</code>, the
			block can be executed any number of times. It keeps going as long
			as the test expression is <code>True</code>. Once the test
			expression is <code>False</code>, we go to the next expression.
			The loop could keep going forever: There is no requirement that
			the test expression eventually becomes <code>False</code>. (We
			call this an infinite loop.)</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>i=0
while i &lt; 10:
	print i
	i = i + 1</code></pre>
			<p>This example is not an infinite loop because we include a

		<h2>Stage 2.5 Debugging</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Bugs Happen!</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Sometimes when you try something
			in code, it just doesn't work the first time. These errors are
			called bugs.</p>
			<p>Writers spend a lot of time proof reading and scientists spend
			a lot of time checking their results. But it was a surprise to
			early programmers that debugging was going to be a thing. A good
			bit of time will be spent finding errors in programs. Andy thought
			that every bug he introduced was some failure on his part as a
			programmer. He realizes now that bugs are inevitable. The
			important thing isn't to avoid them entirely, its to develop a
			strategy for systematically getting rid of them. Its not so much
			about spotting typos or logic errors as it is about building a
			correct mental model of how that system works so that you can find
			out what isn't working.</p>
			<p>Here are some techniques for making debugging part of your
			learning process:</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Examine error messages</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Sometimes its really obvious that
			code has a bug because the bug makes the code crash. When it
			crashes, it usually gives some sort of error message. Error
			messages can be confusing, but they do give some kind of
			information besides just "it didn't work, try something different.
			" When Python code crashes, the message it gives is called a
			Traceback. The traceback tells you what line it crashed on, what
			file it was running, and how it got there. The information the
			traceback gives you, especially the line number and function name,
			can focus your attention on the part of the code that might be
			going wrong. Even if the root of the problem isn't on that exact
			line, its somewhere upstream of that line. We can also look up the
			error message to find out what to do about it.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Work from a Working Example</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>When your learning to use a new
			feature or language, you'll often look at example code to give you
			a model of what to write. Then you'll write code that's based on
			the example code, but change it to do what you want it to. If that
			doesn't work, what then? A lot of new programmers try making
			random changes, when that doesn't work, they ask for help. Here's
			another approach: When your code doesn't work, set it aside,
			comment it out. Then copy and paste in the example code. Run it
			and make sure it does what its supposed to. Then, modify it in
			small steps until it does what you wanted your code to do. Once
			you're done, see if you can find where your original code had a
			bug . Make sure the examples work! When you're working from
			example code, you do have to exercise some care, or could inherit
			bugs from it.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-4">
			<div class="concept-title">Check Intermediate Results</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Bugs that don't crash your program
			can be a lot trickier than ones that do. When a function
			calculates an incorrect value, finding out where it went wrong
			often involves splitting the function up into smaller pieces and
			looking at the value of variables in each of those pieces. One
			basic way to do this is to introduce print statements that output
			the variables where you can see them. Once you are done debugging,
			be sure to remove the print statements or your code will print
			debugging information when you don't want it to.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Keep and Compare Old Versions</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>If you have something almost, but
			not quite working, and you're getting frustrated with it, it can
			be tempting to throw it away and try again. But, sometimes you're
			really close on your first try and your second try isn't as close.
			Then you want to be able to get back to the first version. For
			short functions you can make this easier by commenting out the old
			version. In Python, just put a hash mark (<code>#</code>) before
			each line of the function. Or, you can turn it into a big string
			by putting triple quotes around it. Text editors do have an undo
			feature, but it doesn't usually let you go back between multiple
			different versions of your code. Its not really good enough to let
			you compare different versions of code. Undo is good for when you
			accidentally mess something up and immediately notice it. But you
			can't rely on undo alone to compare different versions of code, or
			to get back to an arbitrary version you previously had. You <em>
			can </em> copy code into a different file. Files aren't exactly
			expensive after all. Just make sure you save them where you can
			find them. Another reason to keep old versions is that when you do
			ask for help, you can share two or three different things you've
			tried. Software engineers use version control systems like Git,
			which are pretty much super-powerful undo systems that let you
			navigate to any version of the code, and have multiple modified
			versions and share different versions and so on. Keeping old
			versions isn't just for beginners, its how software engineering
			really works.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-5-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Debugging as a Scientific Process</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Now you have a few more tools to
			approach problems in your code. This is just the beginning. When
			you really get into it, debugging isn't just correcting errors or
			even just figuring out how you made a mistake. Its a scientific
			process of examining code to discover things you didn't expect in
			it. Debugging is a really important skill to learn if you want to
			do software engineering. In real world computing systems, bugs
			cause problems that are a lot bigger than just getting a weird
			error message. Correctly locating errors is a big part of writing
			reliable software. In fact, we have a whole course on "A
			Scientific Approach to Debugging." After you finish your current
			projects you might want to take a look at that next.</p></div>

		<h2>Stage 2.6 Structured Data: Lists &amp; For Loops</h2>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-1">
			<div class="concept-title">Structured Data</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The closest thing we've seen to
			structured data is the string data type. A string is a kind of
			structured data, we can break it down into its characters. The
			string is a sequence of characters, and we can operate on
			subsequences of the string. What we can do with strings is
			somewhat limited because the only thing we can put in a string is
			a character.</p>
			<p>Today, we're going to introduce the list data type. Lists are
			much more powerful than strings. Whereas for a string, all the
			elements had to be characters, in a list the elements can be
			anything we want. They could be characters, they could be strings,
			they could be numbers, they could also be other lists.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p>String</p>
				<div class="tab"><p>Sequence of characters</p></div>
					<div class="tab-2"><p><code>s = 'yabba!'</code></p></div>
			<p>List</p>
				<div class="tab">Sequence of anything</div>
					<div class="tab-2">
					<code>p = ['y','a','b','b','a','!']</code></div>
			<p>With a list, instead of using quotes to identify the list, we
			use square brackets, and the elements are separated by commas.
			Just like with a string, we can assign the list to a variable.</p>
			<p>With a string, we can use square brackets to select elements:
			<code>s[0]</code> when we index element 0, we'll get the first
			element of the string, in this case <code>'y'</code>.</p>
			<p>With lists, we can also use square brackets to access elements:
			<code>p[0]</code> evaluates to the first element of <code>p</code>
			, which is the string containing the single letter <code>'y'</code>
			.</p>
			<p>With strings, we could use the colon inside square brackets to
			select a substring of more than one character: <code>s[2:4]</code>
			gives us <code>'bb'</code>.</p>
			<p>We can do the same thing with lists: <code>p[2:4]</code>
			Instead of returning a string, it will return a list containing
			those elements: <code>['b','b']</code></p>
			<p>The general grammar for constructing a list is a square
			bracket, followed by a list of any number of expressions, where
			the expressions are separated by commas:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;list&gt; -> [&lt;expression&gt;, &lt;expression&gt;, .
			..]</code></p>
			<p>We could create a list using just two square brackets. This
			would create a list containing zero elements, also known as the
			empty list.</p>
			<p>We could create a list containing one element, or we could
			create a list with many elements, as we did in the first example.
			</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-2">
			<div class="concept-title">Nested Lists</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>All of the examples we've seen so
			far, all of the elements in the list have the same type. We had a
			list where all the elements were strings, we had a list where all
			the elements were numbers.</p>
			<p>There is no restriction on lists, we can make all of the
			elements any type we want. We can mix and match different things
			in one list.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>mixed_up = ['apple', 3, 'oranges', 27,</code></p>
			<p>We've put some strings and some numbers together, thats
			perfectly okay.</p>
			<p>Where it gets even more interesting is we can have a list
			inside a list.</p>
			<p><code>mixed_up = ['apple', 3, 'oranges', 27, [1, 2,</code></p>
			<p>We can have another list inside that:</p>
			<p><code>mixed_up = ['apple', 3, 'oranges', 27, [1, 2, ['alpha',
			'beta']]]</code></p>
			<p>We've defined a new variable <code>mixed_up</code>. It contains
			a string, a number, then a list, the fifth element is itself a
			list that contains a number, a number and contains another list.
			</p>
			<p>This example shows the versatility of lists, that we can put
			anything we want in them. It doesn't seem particularly useful
			because there is no structure to the things we've put in the list.
			</p>
			<p>Lets try another example that may give a better idea of why its
			good to have lists inside lists:</p>
			<p><code>beatles = [['John', 1940],</code></p>
						<div class="tab-4"><p><code>['Paul', 1942],</code></p>
						</div>
						<div class="tab-4"><p><code>['George', 1943],</code>
						</p></div>
						<div class="tab-4"><p><code>['Ringo', 1940]],</code>
						</p></div>
			<p>We've defined the variable <code>beatles</code> as a list of
			lists where each element of the list is a list of the person as
			well as the date when he was born.</p>
			<p>In Python, its okay to divide a list into several lines, as
			long as we do the separation after a comma, so Python knows
			they're part of the same list. Use indentation to further help you
			see that they are part of the same list.</p>
			<p>We can <code>print beatles[3]</code> and get <code>['Ringo',
			1940]</code>.</p>
			<p>If we want just a name, we can print <code>beatles[3][0]</code>
			and get <code>Ringo</code>.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-3">
			<div class="concept-title">Mutation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>There are two main differences
			between strings and lists. The first is that a list can hold
			anything we want but a string can only be made up of characters.
			The second big difference between list and strings is that lists
			support mutation. Mutation sounds a little bit scary and in some
			ways it is. It makes it much harder to understand what our
			programs mean, but its also very powerful.</p>
			<p>What mutation means is that we can change the value of a list
			after we've created it.</p>
			<p>To explain what that means and to see why its so different from
			the behavior we can get with strings, lets recap what happens with
			strings:</p>
			<p>We can create a string and store it in a variable:</p>
			<p><code>s = 'Hello'</code></p>
			<p>We can change the value of the variable by creating a new
			string:</p>
			<p><code>s = 'Yello'</code></p>
			<p>Whats going on there is changing the value of <code>s</code>,
			not changing the value of the string. <code>s = 'Yello'</code>
			doesn't change the value of <code>'Hello'</code>, we just don't
			have a way to refer to that string any more.</p>
			<p>With strings we can also use the <code>+</code> operator to
			concatenate two strings.</p>
			<p><code>s = s + 'w'</code></p>
			<p>It looks like this is changing the value of the string. You
			might think the result of this is the string that was
			<code>'Yello'</code> is now changed to <code>'Yellow'</code>.
			Thats not actually what happens. We don't actually modify the
			string we had. What happens when we use the <code>+</code>
			operator is it creates a completely new string, where the value of
			the new string is the result of concatenating the two strings. The
			assignment changes what the variable refers to, to refer to the
			new string.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-4">
			<div class="concept-title">A List of Strings</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>
			<code>p = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']</code></p>
			<p>We've created a list, using the square brackets, that contains
			five strings, each one is a one letter string spelling out the
			word Hello. We've stored that list in the variable <code>p</code>.
			</p>
			<p>We could do the same thing we did with strings. We could
			reassign <code>p</code> to a new value:</p>
			<p><code>p = ['Y', 'e', 'l', 'l' 'o']</code></p>
			<p>Instead, we're going to mutate the list we've already created.
			</p>
			<p>We can do that by modifying the value of its elements:</p>
			<p><code>p[0] = 'Y'</code></p>
			<p>Here we have an assignment where on the left side of the
			assignment we have <code>p[0]</code>, this means select from the
			list that <code>p</code> refers to, find position <code>0</code>,
			and instead of getting the value of that position, since its an
			assignment, we're going to replace that value with what's on the
			right side of the assignment, in this case the string containing
			the single letter <code>'Y'</code>. <code>'H'</code> will be
			replaced by <code>'Y'</code>. Note that we did not create a new
			list, <code>p</code> still refers to the same list, but we've
			changed the value of that list.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-5">
			<div class="concept-title">Yello Mutation</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Mutation modifies the existing
			object, but you can't really see the difference from what we've
			done with strings. Where we'll really see the difference is when
			we introduce a new variable.</p>
			<p>Lets go back to the example we had before:</p>
			<p><code>p = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']</code></p>
			<p><code>p[0] = 'Y'</code></p>
			<p>Now we're going to add an extra assignment statement and
			introduce a new variable:</p>
			<p><code>q = p</code></p>
			<p>We introduce the variable <code>q</code>, and we assign
			<code>p</code> to <code>q</code>. That means the value of
			<code>p</code>, the list, is what <code>q</code> will refer to.
			After the assignment <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> refer to
			the same list.</p>
			<p>Suppose we did an assignment statement to modify one of the
			elements of <code>q</code>:</p>
			<p><code>q[4] = '!'</code></p>
			<p>That will change the 4th element of <code>q</code>. It also
			changes the value of <code>p</code>, even though the assignment
			statement didn't include <code>p</code>. The fact that
			<code>p</code> and <code>q</code> refer to the same object means
			that it changes the value of <code>p</code>.</p> <p>A key
			difference between mutable objects and immutable objects is once
			an object is mutable, then we have to worry about other variables
			that might refer to the same object. We can change the value of
			that object, and it affects not just the variable that we think we
			changed, it affects the value of other variables as well.

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-6">
			<div class="concept-title">Aliasing</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>When we have two different ways to
			refer to the same object, that is called aliasing.</p>
			<p>Aliasing in programs is similar to the way we think about
			aliasing in spy craft. We can refer to James Bond by his name or
			his spy name, 007. Both of those are ways to refer to the same
			person. If something happens that changes the state of James Bond,
			it affects the state of both James Bond and 007. Both names refer
			to the same person, so whatever state that person has is true for
			both names.</p>
			<p>Aliasing for variable names has the same property. If we have
			two variable names that refer to the same object, say
			<code>p</code> and <code>q</code>, any change we make to the
			object <code> p</code> refers to also affects the value that
			<code>q</code> refers to.</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-7">
			<div class="concept-title">List Operations</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Lists are very powerful, by using
			mutation, by having lists that can contain other lists or any
			other kind of data we want, we can build very complex data
			structures and we can do lots of interesting things. We've seen
			that we can use lists to store complex data, that elements of the
			list can be any type we want, including other lists, and we've
			seen we can use mutation to change the value of the list, and that
			mutation is visible to any reference to the same list object.</p>
			<p>One more list operation will allow us to add a new element at
			the end of the list:</p>
			<p><code>append</code></p>
			<p><code>append</code> is like a procedure, but its a method. We
			use it similar to the way we use find on strings:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;list&gt;.append(&lt;element&gt;)</code></p>
			<p><code>append</code> will add a new element to the end of the
			list. The important thing about <code>append</code> is its
			mutating the list that its invoked on, its not creating a new
			list, its mutating the old list.</p>
			<p>Example:</p>
			<p><code>stooges=['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']</code></p>
			<p>Lets assume that instead of replacing Curly we want to end up
			with four stooges. We'll add Shemp and keep the other three as
			they are.</p>
			<p><code>stooges.append('Shemp')</code></p>
			<p>We have not created a new list. There is no assignment from the
			result of <code>append</code>. What we've done is modify the value
			that <code>stooges</code> refers to by adding a new element to it.
			</p>
			<p>Another list operation:</p>
			<p><code>+</code> (plus.)</p>
			<p><code>&lt;list&gt; + &lt;list&gt;</code></p>
			<p><code>+</code> behaves very similar to the concatenation
			operation for strings:</p>
			<p><code>[0, 1] + [2, 3]</code></p>
			<p>Result is the list <code>[0, 1, 2, 3]</code></p>
			<p>What <code>+</code> does, like concatenation for strings, is it
			produces a new list. It doesn't mutate either of the input lists.
			</p>
			<p>One other list operator:</p>
			<p><code>len</code></p>
			<p><code>len</code> is short for length.</p>
			<p><code>len(&lt;list&gt;)</code></p>
			<p><code>len</code> is a function call, its just a function
			already included in Python. We pass into <code>len</code> the
			object we want to know the length of.</p>
			<p><code>len</code> works for many other things than lists. It
			also works for strings, it works for any object thats a collection
			of things.</p>
			<p>The output from <code>len</code> is the number of elements in
			the input.</p>
			<p><code>len([0,1])</code> result is 2</p>
			<p><code>len(['a', ['b,' ['c']]])</code> result is also 2. It
			looks like there are more elements, but <code>len</code> is only
			counting the outer elements. If one of the elements of a list is a
			list, it doesn't matter how many elements it contains, it only
			contributes one to the length of the original list.</p>
			<p><code>len ("Udacity")</code> We can use len on a string. The
			output will be the number of characters in a string. In this case,
			7.</p>
			<p><code>index</code></p>
			<p><code>&lt;list&gt;.index(&lt;value&gt;)</code></p>
			<p>The <code>index</code> method is invoked on a list, you pass in
			a value, and the output is the first position that value exists in
			the list. When we invoke <code>index</code> on a list that doesn't
			contain value we pass in, <code>index</code> doesn't return -1, it
			gives us an error.</p>
			<p>To help deal with that error, we have two more operators:</p>
			<p><code>in</code></p>
			<p><code>&lt;value&gt; in &lt;list&gt;</code></p>
			<p>Syntax: a value, the in word, followed by the list.</p>
			<p>Returns a boolean <code>True</code> or <code>False</code></p>
			<p><code>not in</code></p>
			<p><code>&lt;value&gt; not in &lt;list&gt;</code></p>
			<p>If the value is not in the list the result is <code>True</code>.
			 If it is in the list the result is <code>False</code>.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-8">
			<div class="concept-title">Loops on Lists</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>How to loop through a list: Since
			lists are collections of things, its very useful to be able to go
			through a list and do something with every element of the list.</p>
			<p>Remember the <code>while</code> loop from the previous unit:</p>
			<p><code>while &lt;test&gt;:</code></p>
				<p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p>
			<p>As a reminder, this is the way the while loop works: we have a
			<code>while</code> followed by a test expression, which is
			something that evaluates to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
			 , when it evaluates to <code>True</code>, that means to execute
			 the block, which can be of any number of statements we want. We
			 keep executing the block as long as the test expression evaluates
			 to <code>True</code>.</p>
			<p>We can use a <code>while</code> loop on a list:</p>
<pre><code>def print_all_elements(p):
i = 0
while i &lt; len(p)
	print p[i]
	i = i + 1</code></pre></div>
		</div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-6-9">
			<div class="concept-title">For Loops</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>We can write all the code we need
			to loop through the elements of a list just using
			<code>while</code>. It would just be a little more complicated
			than we want.</p>
			<p>Python provides a simpler way to loop through the elements of a
			list: The <code>for</code> loop.</p>
			<p><code>for &lt;name&gt; in &lt;list&gt;:</code></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><code>&lt;Block&gt;</code></p></div>
			<p>The structure of a <code>for</code> loop is like this: We have
			the keyword <code>for</code>, followed by a name, (this is a new
			name for a variable that we can introduce,) the the keyword <code>
			in</code>, followed by a list, followed by a colon, with a block
			inside the <code>for</code>.</p>
			<p>What a <code>for</code> loop like this means is that for each
			element in the list, we're going to assign that element to the
			<code>&lt;name&gt;</code> and evaluate the block, and we'll do that
			in order, going through the list.</p>
			<p>Using <code>for</code> we can define
			<code>print_all_elements</code> using far less elements than we
			did using <code>while</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def print_all_elements(p:)
	for e in p:
		print e</code></pre>
			<p>We can use for loops on nested lists too:</p>
<pre><code>example_list_2 = [['China', 'Beijing'],
				['USA'  , 'Washington D.C.'],
				['India', 'Delhi']]
for country_with_capital in example_list_2:
	country = country_with_capital[0]
	capital = country_with_capital[1]
	print capital + ' is the capital of ' + country</code></pre></div>

			<div class="concept-content"><p>Solving problems is one of the

			<p>One short lesson is not going to be enough to make anyone an
			expert problem solver, but for this lesson we're going to look at
			how to approach more complex programming problems, and hopefully
			that will help you with solving any problem you are faced with
			from now on.</p>
			<p>It doesn't really make any sense to talk about solving problems
			without talking about particular problems. We're going to look at
			a specific practice problem and talk about how to go about solving
			it. Our goal by looking at a particular problem is not just to
			solve that problem, but to draw general lessons.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-7-3">
			<div class="concept-title">First Step</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>What is the first thing we should

			<p>Make sure we understand the problem. Other steps may get us to

			<div class="concept-title">Understanding a Computational Problem
			</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Given your birthday and the

			<p>What all computational problems have in common is they have
			inputs (your birthday and the current date) and they have desired
			outputs (your age in days.)</p>
			<p>The problem is defined by the set of possible inputs, and the
			relationship between those inputs and the desired outputs.</p>
			<p>A solution to a problem is a procedure that can take any input
			in the set of possible inputs and produce as output the desired
			output we want.</p></div>

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-7-5">
			<div class="concept-title">The First Rule</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>The first rule in our Pythonista's
			Guide To All Problems in the Galaxy, is: 1. What are the inputs?
			</p>
			<p>There is one rule before the first rule, the zeroth rule: 0.
			Don't Panic! If you panic, you're never going to solve the problem.
			</p>
			<p>1. What are the inputs? In this case its very clearly stated:
			"your birthday and the current date."</p>
			<p>What is the set of inputs we want this to work for?</p>
			<p>Inputs: two dates (that gives us a set of all possible inputs)
			</p>
			<p>What is the set of valid inputs?</p>
			<p>"Assume that the birthday and current date are correct dates (
			and no time travel.)" The second date also needs to be after the
			first one. If we're being good defensive programmers, we should
			check if this is true.</p>
			<p>We're also going to require that the dates are valid dates in
			the Gregorian calendar, which started on Oct 15, 1582.</p>
			<p>Assumptions like this make life easier for programmers. They
			make it easier to write our code since it has to work for fewer
			possible inputs.</p>
			<p>For most real world problems, its up to you to figure out how
			to encode the inputs. This is one of the most important decisions
			you can make in solving a problem.</p>
			<p>In this case, the template for the problem indicates how the

			number, we can do more things with it later.</p>
			<p>Now we have the second step in Pythonista's Guide To All

		<div class="concept" id="stage-2-7-12">
			<div class="concept-title">Should We Implement It</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>Should we implement our algorithm?
			The best answer is no. The pseudocode is already fairly complex,
			and it doesn't handle lots of cases. It doesn't handle: Input
			dates in same month, <code>month2</code> before <code>month1</code>
			 (which can easily happen with a different year,) or Counting days
			 in leap years. We could try to fix the code to try to handle
			 these cases, but our goal as programmers should be to try to find
			 a simple solution first. Something this complicated is very
			 difficult to get correct. Once you start handling lots of special
			 cases, its really hard to get them all right.</p>
			<p>Lets start by thinking of a simpler way. Often the way humans
			solve a problem is not the simplest way, because humans are lazy,
			we try to find shortcuts instead of doing things in a real simple,
			mechanical way. On the other hand, computers are not lazy, doing
			things in a simple mechanical way is great for computers, makes
			the program easier to write, and makes it more likely for the

			and count the days. Go one day at a time. Keep doing this until we
			get to our target date.</p>
			<p>Pseudocode for a simple mechanical algorithm:</p>
			<p><em>days = 0</em></p>
			<p><em>while date1 is before date2:</em></p>
				<div class="tab"><p><em>date1 = advance to next day</em></p>

Instead of starting with daysBetweenDates, it would make more sense to write the helper procedure that determines the stopping condition.</p>
<pre><code>def dateIsBefore(year1, month1, day1, year2, month2, day2):
	if year1 &lt; year:
		return True
	if year1 == year2:
		if month1 &lt; month2:
			return True
		if month1 == month2:
			return day1 &lt; day2
	return False</code></pre></div>

			<div class="concept-title">Finish daysBetweenDate</div>
			<div class="concept-content"><p>For the answer, we're going to
			show you how we actually solved this, developing incrementally
			&amp; testing as we went.</p>
			<p>First we wrote a stub, <code>daysInMonth(year, month)</code>
			that always returns 30.</p>
			<p>Then, we modified our <code>nextDay(year, month, day)</code>
			routine to use that stub.</p>
			<p>Then, we tested <code>nextDay(year, month, day)</code> using
			the stub <code>daysInMonth</code>.</p>
			<p>Next, we modified <code>daysInMonth(year, month</code>to be
			correct except for leap years.</p>
			<p>Then, we tested <code>daysInMonth(year, month)</code> except
			for leap years.</p>
			<p>Next, we wrote <code>isLeapYear(year)</code>.</p>
			<p>Then we tested <code>isLeapYear(year)</code> separately.</p><p>
			Finally, we tested <code>daysBetweenDates(...)</code> for all test
			cases.</p>
			<p>The important thing is that we wrote small bits of code that we
			tested independently as we went. Incremental testing makes
			debugging easier. One of the most important things to learn as a
			developer is to think of ways to structure code so you're able to
			do meaningful tests as you go, and see the code get incrementally
			closer to the solution that you need for the end.</p>
